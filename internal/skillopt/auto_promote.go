// EvaluateAutoPromote is the pure, deterministic, total auto-promote guardrail
// evaluator (#471). It takes the host [skillopt] policy, the just-imported
// candidate package, and the feedback events of the candidate's eval_run, and
// returns a promote/notify-only decision + reason. It performs NO I/O and NEVER
// mutates state: the CLI helper resolves the eval_run, calls this, and only on a
// Promote=true result invokes the EXISTING PromoteAgentTemplateVersion.
//
// FAIL-SAFE DISCIPLINE (every uncertainty returns Promote=false):
//   - policy.AutoPromote off (the default) -> notify only (manual, byte-identical).
//   - feedbackUnavailable=true (the caller could not resolve/read the eval_run, e.g.
//     a ListFeedbackEvents error or a missing run id) -> hard do-not-promote: we can
//     never promote on evidence we failed to read, regardless of the configured
//     min_samples floor.
//   - require_measured_judge=true -> DEFERRED (#344): no judge<->human calibration
//     source exists, so honoring it now would lie; fail safe.
//   - canary=true -> DEFERRED (canary follow-on): the sampled-traffic + regression
//     infrastructure does not exist; fail safe.
//   - ZERO feedback samples -> a HARD do-not-promote (an absolute floor of at least
//     one real sample), even when min_samples is explicitly 0: we never promote on
//     zero verifiable evidence.
//   - min_samples unset (nil) -> a HARD do-not-promote, NOT 0 (a user who flips
//     auto_promote without a sample floor must never promote a sparse candidate).
//   - min_score unset (nil) OR a nil candidate Summary.Score -> hard do-not-promote
//     ON THE MODE A (verifiable-outcome) PATH. A genuine Mode B (ask/research)
//     candidate has NO harvester score; its evidence is the pairwise bandit, so the
//     score/feedback-sample floors are satisfied by the confidence + bandit-pull
//     floor instead (see modeBConfidenceBacked below) and a nil score is allowed.
//   - require_external_ci=true with no real-CI positive in the run -> do not promote
//     (still hard, including on the Mode B path: a pure ask agent has no CI, so an
//     operator simply leaves require_external_ci off; if they DO set it we fail safe).
//   - min_confidence (#473 Mode B) is ADDITIVE and OPTIONAL: when
//     policy.AutoPromoteMinConfidence is nil (the default) the bandit confidence is
//     ignored entirely and behavior is byte-identical to #471 — `confidence` may be
//     nil. When the floor IS set, promote additionally requires a non-nil
//     confidence >= the floor AND at least AutoPromoteMinSamples bandit samples
//     behind it (small-sample over-confidence guard); a nil/low confidence or thin
//     evidence FAILS SAFE to notify-only.
//
// MODE B PATH (the ask/research loop this slice closes): when AutoPromoteMinConfidence
// is set AND a confidence backed by >= AutoPromoteMinSamples bandit pulls is present,
// the bandit pulls ARE the sample evidence and the pairwise preference IS the quality
// signal — so the bandit-pull floor stands in for len(feedbackEvents) (a Mode B
// candidate has zero harvester feedback rows) and the nil-score hard stop is skipped.
// This is what makes a real ask-agent candidate (empty feedbackEvents, nil score)
// reachable by the confidence gate; without it the zero-evidence / nil-score hard
// stops above would make Mode B auto-promotion structurally unreachable. A score, if
// present, must still clear min_score; require_external_ci, if set, must still hold.
//
// `confidence` is the Mode B P(challenger>champion) the runCandidateNotify seam
// supplies from the bandit (nil when there is no arm); `confidenceSamples` is the
// challenger arm's pull count behind it (0 when absent). Both are ignored unless
// AutoPromoteMinConfidence is set, so EXISTING callers/tests are unchanged in
// behavior.
//
// On a pass the reason names the guardrails that held (score, samples, external CI,
// confidence) so the candidate.auto_promoted event explains the decision.
