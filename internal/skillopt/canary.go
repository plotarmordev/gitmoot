// AutoPromoteMinSamples — no new knob), and per-side "could not read the feedback"
// flags, it returns rollback / graduate / continue with a reason. It performs NO
// I/O and NEVER mutates state: the daemon resolves the two runs, calls this, and
// acts on the verdict via the EXISTING store rollback/graduate transactions.
//
// BOUNDED WINDOW: BOTH event lists are first filtered to the canary window
// (CreatedAt >= windowStart) so the canary's fresh outcomes are compared against
// the champion's outcomes OVER THE SAME PERIOD, not the champion's entire-lifetime
// mean. This makes it a true simultaneous A/B: a long-lived champion whose old
// outcomes dragged its lifetime mean down (or up) can no longer produce a stale
// baseline that wrongly graduates a regressing canary (or rolls back a healthy
// one). When windowStart is empty/unparseable the filter is skipped (fail-open to
// the prior lifetime baseline), and an event whose own CreatedAt cannot be parsed
// is kept (never silently dropped).
//
// FAIL-SAFE DISCIPLINE (inverted vs. #471's promote: here uncertainty leaves the
// champion live AND keeps the canary sampling — it never rolls back and never
// graduates):
//   - canaryUnavailable (a read error on the canary's run) -> continue: we never
//     throw away a canary on evidence we could not read.
//   - fewer than minSamples countable canary outcomes -> continue: the window is
//     not yet decisive; keep sampling.
//   - championUnavailable, or zero countable champion outcomes -> continue: with no
//     baseline we can neither confirm a regression (so never rollback) nor confirm
//     non-regression (so never graduate) — hold.
//   - minSamples <= 0 -> continue: an unset/zero floor would let a single noisy
//     sample decide; refuse to act without a real floor (mirrors the #471 unset
//     min_samples hard stop).
//
// DECISION (only when both sides have read, decisive evidence):
//   - canary score materially below champion (by >= canaryRegressionDelta) -> rollback.
//   - otherwise (parity or improvement, within the buffer) -> graduate.
