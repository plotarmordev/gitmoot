// KillDelegationTree is the operator kill switch (#341). It marks the delegation
// tree as killed so the engine and daemon stop expanding it, then returns the
// killed root job.
//
// jobID may be ANY job in the tree — the root coordinator or any child/
// continuation. A child carries payload.RootJobID; the kill is always applied to
// that real root, since the engine and daemon only ever consult the root's flag.
// Passing a child id therefore kills the whole tree rather than silently marking a
// row nothing reads.
//
// The kill is graceful, not a hard stop: it does NOT cancel in-flight jobs. The
// flag takes effect at the two expansion points:
//
//   - the engine's dispatchDelegations sees IsRootJobKilled as its first backstop
//     and, on the coordinator's next continuation, routes through the #305 graceful
//     finalize continuation (synthesize what completed → stop) instead of
//     dispatching the next generation; and
//   - the daemon skips queued child legs of a killed root (continuations still run).
//
// In-flight children run to completion normally. The job must exist; an unknown id
// is an error so an operator typo does not silently no-op.

			// lock while its process is mid-flight would let a competing same-key job (a
			// continuation, or a foreground `agent ask`/`agent run`) acquire it and run
			// concurrently against the same runtime session / working tree — risking
			// session or git-index corruption. The kill is graceful: running children
			// keep executing and release their own locks via their token-scoped deferred
			// ReleaseResourceLock when they finish.

			// The running-or-not test MUST be evaluated atomically against the CURRENT
			// job state, not the j.State captured in the ListJobsByRoot snapshot above:
			// a child selected by an in-flight daemon tick (e.g. the barrier scheduler
			// built it into `pending` before root_killed committed) can transition
			// queued->running AFTER its snapshot row was read. Trusting the stale
			// snapshot state would delete that now-running child's live lock. So we use
			// DeleteResourceLocksByOwnerIfNotRunning, whose `NOT EXISTS (... state=
			// 'running')` clause mirrors DeleteExpiredResourceLocks and skips the delete
			// in the same statement that reads the live state. A just-cancelled queued
			// child (transitioned to cancelled just above) is terminal, so its lock is
			// correctly released; the root and any already-terminal descendants release
			// too — only in-flight (running) legs are kept.
			// The call returns 0 on a re-kill, so the lock_released event is not
			// duplicated. This mirrors CancelJob, which only frees locks for the job it
