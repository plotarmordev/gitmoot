// TestE2E560LeaseGraceGuardsTeardownWindow is the load-bearing SAFETY E2E for the
// #536-safe layer on top of plotarmordev's #560 (make stale-running recovery
// configurable + reap expired runtime-session locks). It drives the REAL
// production chain end to end:
//
//   - REAL jobWorker.run() with a codex (resumable) agent, so run() itself sizes
//     and acquires the runtime-session lease from lockTTL = jobTimeout +
//     runtimeLeaseTeardownGrace while arming the run context at exactly jobTimeout.
//   - a fake adapter that BLOCKS inside Deliver, standing in for a live worker that
//     has passed its run-context deadline and is now in terminal teardown (runtime
//     kill + worktree force-clean) while STILL holding its lease.
//   - the REAL recovery chain (runDaemonWorkerTick ->
//     recoverExpiredRuntimeSessionLocks -> DeleteExpiredResourceLocks) against the
//     REAL db.Store, fired at a simulated time INSIDE the teardown grace window:
//     after t0+jobTimeout (context deadline) but before the lease expires.
//
// THE #536 GUARD (load-bearing): that recovery tick must NOT reap the live
// worker's lease and must NOT requeue its still-'running' owner. Reaping+requeuing
// here would start a SECOND worker on the dirty in-flight worktree — the exact
// #536 clobber. This flips RED under the grace=0 mutation (see the package const
// runtimeLeaseTeardownGrace): with no grace the lease expires at t0+jobTimeout,
// strictly before teardown completes, so the reaper deletes it and requeues the
// owner inside the window.
//
// Credit: builds on plotarmordev's #560.
