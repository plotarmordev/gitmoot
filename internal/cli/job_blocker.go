// Issue #532 (first slice): classify OPERATIONAL blockers — failures caused by
// the environment the job ran in (runtime auth rejected, provider rate
// limit/quota), not by the agent's work — and defer the job for automatic
// re-dispatch instead of terminally failing it indistinguishably from a product
// failure.
//
// Scope discipline (all guards below are load-bearing):
//   - Only a job that ended JobFailed WITHOUT a stored gitmoot_result is
//     eligible: a stored result means the agent DID answer (a `failed` decision
//     is a product failure and must never be auto-retried).
//   - Delegation children (ParentJobID set) are excluded: their retry/failure
//     policy belongs to the delegation DAG (finalizeTimedOutDelegationChild →
//     advanceDelegations), which already owns retry semantics for children.
//   - Only the two cleanest classes are matched (runtime_auth, runtime_quota),
//     reusing the #552 classifyAuthQuota signatures (per line, with tightened
//     HTTP-status arms — see classifyAuthQuotaStrict) plus the adapters' typed
//     runtime.ErrClaudeAuthFailed sentinel, so detection stays grounded in
//     strings the adapters actually emit. String matching additionally requires
//     the typed workflow.DeliveryError marker, so only errors from the delivery
//     seam — never agent-authored contract/validation text — can classify.
//   - A run whose delivery COMPLETED (persisted RawOutputs) is never deferred,
//     and every deferred retry is at-least-once for side effects: Mailbox.Run
//     prepends a reconciliation notice to a blocker-retried prompt.
//   - Auto-retries are hard-bounded by maxOperationalBlockerRetries; when the
//     budget is exhausted the job stays terminally failed exactly like today.
//
// Every job that does not hit a classified blocker takes the existing path
// byte-identically: the mailbox's injected BlockerDeferrer
// (deferOperationalBlockerPreTerminal, #532 slice E) only diverts a run when it
// classifies AND every scope guard passes; otherwise Mailbox.Run fails the job
// exactly as before.

// blockerClass names a class of operational blocker. Persisted in the job
// payload (blocker_class) and rendered by the #552 stuck-reason surface, so the
