// The #413 escape: a worktree-less delegation child (a delegation leg with an
// empty WorktreePath) inherits its coordinator's branch but can only resolve the
// repo's registered shared checkout, which sits on `main`. Before #413, the
// implement/review arms of defaultCheckout validated that shared checkout against
// payload.Branch and failed it with "checkout branch is main, not job branch
// <X>" — even though the engine's delegation_worktree_skipped fallback runs the
// child against the shared checkout (holding its branch lock) on purpose. #413
// extends #389's ask-arm escape to the implement/review arms for that child only.
//
// These tests reuse the daemon checkout seams (a temp git checkout on `main`, the
// real defaultCheckout) so they exercise the production code path end-to-end.

// T1 (implement) + LOAD-BEARING: the escape fires for a worktree-less delegation
// implement child (DelegationID set, WorktreePath "", Branch "feature-x") — it is
// NOT rejected against the `main` checkout — AND validateImplementationLock still
// runs (the unconditional branch-lock guard). This test FAILS against pre-fix
// code, where defaultCheckout returns the "checkout branch is main, not job
// branch feature-x" error from validateTargetCheckout before the lock is ever
// consulted.
