// Issue #532 slice C: classify the daemon-owned pre-flight CHECKOUT strings —
// which today TERMINALLY fail a job through finishQueuedJob — and defer the job
// for automatic re-dispatch instead. Two sub-classes of the checkout_contention
// class, both keyed off strings the daemon itself emits (validateTargetCheckout /
// validateReviewCheckout / validateImplementationLock):
//
//   - branch-LOCK contention ("branch %s is locked by %s"): another worker holds
//     the branch lock. It self-heals the moment that worker finishes (#328/#329
//     checkout-key serialization already makes most contention never even reach
//     here), so it defers with a SHORT EXPONENTIAL backoff and no suggested_action.
//   - DIRTY / WRONG-HEAD ("checkout %s has uncommitted changes", "checkout head
//     is %s, not …", "checkout branch is %s, not …"): the registered checkout is
//     not in the state the job needs. That usually needs a human to clean/reset
//     the checkout, so it defers with a fixed backoff AND a suggested_action
//     surfaced through the #552 stuck surface.
//
// Scope discipline (mirrors slice A):
//   - Delegation children (ParentJobID set) are EXCLUDED and keep their existing
//     DAG routing (finishQueuedJob → finalizePreflightDelegationChild → the
//     delegation failure_policy, #409). This slice only diverts non-delegation
//     jobs whose pre-flight checkout failed.
//   - Auto-retries share the SAME hard budget as the other classes
//     (maxOperationalBlockerRetries): a contention that outlives the budget stays
//     terminally failed exactly like today (with the suggested_action preserved in
//     the payload/stuck surface).
//   - The job is deferred from the QUEUED state (the pre-flight runs before the
//     mailbox claims queued→running), so no state transition happens — the hold is
//     just the payload fields + a blocker_deferred event, and listPendingQueuedJobs'
//     queuedJobBlockerHeld gate holds it. Because finishQueuedJob is never called,
//     NO job.failed precedes the additive job.deferred (the pre-terminal property,
//     same as slice E's mailbox seam).
