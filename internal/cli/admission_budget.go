// admissionBudget is the process-global, memory-aware concurrency gate the daemon
// consults at the single dispatch decision in each scheduler (issue #365). It is
// a stricter SECOND gate layered on --workers/pool and the per-repo checkout /
// runtime-session locks: a job is admitted only if it fits BOTH the session-count
// cap AND the summed-RAM cap; otherwise it is left queued (deferred), to be
// retried on a later dispatch pass/tick.
//
// A nil *admissionBudget means the feature is OFF — callers MUST treat a nil
// receiver as "always admit, never accounts", so default (no [admission] config)
// scheduling is byte-identical. Both Reserve and Release are no-ops on a nil
// receiver.
//
// Concurrency: reserve must check-and-add under ONE lock so the count cap and the
// memory cap are enforced atomically together (two independent atomics cannot).
// A single Mutex around a tiny critical section is race-clean and negligible at
// daemon tick cadence. Reservations are keyed by job ID so Release is idempotent
// (a double release — e.g. pool reap plus a panic-recovery path — never
// double-credits the budget) and a re-reserve of the same in-flight job ID is a
// no-op success.

// whether the job consumed a max_concurrent_sessions slot — only session jobs
// (queuedJobRuntimeResourceKey != "") do; a non-session job (shell runtime, or an

// the estimate is a thunk so its config read + DB lookups are skipped entirely on
// the off path (and for an already-in-flight job).
//
// est is computed at most once, only after the nil/idempotency checks, and only
// when at least one gate is active. A non-session estimate (session=false) does
// NOT consume a max_concurrent_sessions slot — it is "not session-counted" per
// the frozen goal — and contributes 0 RAM. A job ID already reserved (in flight)
// is admitted again as a no-op so a re-dispatch is safe. Otherwise the job is
