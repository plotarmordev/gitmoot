# Run Jobs In Parallel On A Repo

By default the daemon runs queued jobs **one at a time per repo**: `--workers`
defaults to `1` and the scheduler defaults to `barrier` (a per-tick batch that
serializes same-repo jobs on one checkout lock). That is the safe, conservative
default — but it means a fan-out of independent jobs on one repo runs serially
unless you opt in to parallelism.

This guide shows the one-step on-ramp.

## The short version

```sh
# Intent-level: workers + the pool scheduler together, named for the goal.
gitmoot daemon start --parallel 5

# Equivalent, explicit form:
gitmoot daemon start --workers 5 --scheduler pool
```

`--parallel N` sets `--workers N` **and** `--scheduler pool` in one flag. It is
sugar for the explicit pair and cannot be combined with `--workers` or
`--scheduler` (that would be ambiguous).

If you raise `--workers` above 1 and do **not** pass `--scheduler`, the daemon now
**auto-selects `pool`** for you — requesting multiple workers under the serializing
`barrier` is almost never what anyone wants:

```sh
gitmoot daemon start --workers 5     # auto-selects --scheduler pool
```

To keep the old per-tick semantics with multiple workers, ask for them
explicitly — an explicit `--scheduler barrier` is always honored:

```sh
gitmoot daemon start --workers 5 --scheduler barrier
```

## Confirm the daemon is configured for it

`gitmoot daemon status` reports the scheduler mode and worker count, so you can
answer "is the daemon actually set up for the parallelism I asked for?" without
re-deriving it from launch flags:

```text
daemon running pid 12345
log: ~/.gitmoot/logs/daemon.log
scheduler: pool, workers: 5
claude auth: ok (...)
```

If you started under `barrier` with multiple workers, the line flags it and points
at the fix.

## Preflight warning

If a parallelizable workload is queued under a serializing config, the daemon
**logs an actionable warning** with the exact relaunch command instead of silently
serializing the work:

```text
warning: 3 parallelizable jobs queued for owner/repo will run serially under the
current scheduler config; relaunch with: gitmoot daemon restart --parallel 3
```

"Parallelizable" is counted conservatively: same repo, dependency-unblocked
(already true of queued jobs), and **distinct runtime sessions** (see the next
section). Two jobs on the same agent session are *not* counted as parallelizable,
because they serialize regardless of the scheduler.

The warning is rate-limited: it is re-logged only when the parallelizable set
changes, not on every poll, so a steady backlog does not spam the daemon log.

## What actually runs in parallel (two serialization layers)

Parallelism under `pool` is bounded by **two** independent locks, not one:

1. **Checkout lock (per worktree).** Jobs run concurrently only when they have
   **distinct checkout keys**. Delegation / orchestra `implement` children already
   get their own worktree from the workflow engine, so they parallelize. Read-only
   `ask`/`review` jobs can be auto-isolated into an ephemeral detached worktree.
   A plain, top-level same-repo `implement` job with **no** worktree still shares
   the `repo:<repo>` key and serializes even under `pool`.
2. **Runtime session lock (`runtime:<runtime>:<ref>`).** Two jobs that use the
   **same agent/runtime session** serialize on the session lock even if their
   checkouts differ. So same-repo parallelism is bounded by **distinct runtime
   sessions** — give the work distinct sessions (or distinct agents) to spread it
   across the pool. This applies to resumable runtimes (Codex `thread_id`, Claude,
   Kimi); the checkout lock is runtime-agnostic, the session lock is not.

The practical recipe for N-wide same-repo work today is therefore: **N
delegation/orchestra legs** (each engine-isolated into its own worktree) running
under **distinct runtime sessions**, with `--parallel N`.

## Not yet automatic (follow-ups)

- **Top-level `implement` auto-isolation.** `pool` does *not* auto-isolate plain
  same-repo `implement` jobs into worktrees — only read-only `ask`/`review` jobs.
  Parallelizing independent top-level `implement` jobs via the daemon needs
  implement-eligible auto-isolation (a real branch worktree + branch-lock handling
  + a worktree cap and disposal sweep); that is intentionally deferred.
- **`daemon reconfigure`.** Changing workers/scheduler today still needs a daemon
  restart. A drain-not-drop reconfigure that preserves daemon auth is a planned
  follow-up.
