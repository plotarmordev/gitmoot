# Agent Result Contract

Every Gitmoot agent job ends by returning a single `gitmoot_result` JSON object.
The result is how an agent reports its outcome, records what it actually did, and
optionally requests follow-up work from other agents. Gitmoot parses this object
after the runtime delivers the agent's output and uses it to drive the rest of
the workflow, so it should be concise, truthful, and tied to work that really
happened.

## The `gitmoot_result` Shape

At a high level the result captures a decision, a short summary, and several
arrays that describe the work:

```json
{
  "gitmoot_result": {
    "decision": "approved|changes_requested|blocked|implemented|failed",
    "summary": "Brief outcome.",
    "findings": [],
    "changes_made": [],
    "tests_run": [],
    "needs": [],
    "delegations": []
  }
}
```

The `decision` field reports the outcome of the job:

- `approved`: a review found no blocking issues.
- `changes_requested`: a review found issues that should be fixed before merge.
- `blocked`: work cannot continue without human input or an external state
  change.
- `implemented`: the requested implementation work was completed.
- `failed`: the attempted action errored or could not complete.

The narrative and evidence fields are reporting-only. Do not claim tests were run
in `tests_run` unless they were actually run, and do not list files in
`changes_made` unless they were actually changed. Use `needs` for missing
credentials, unclear scope, unavailable tools, failing external services, or
required human decisions. Always redact secrets from summaries, findings, raw
command output, and examples.

## Delegations (Orchestration)

The `delegations` array is how an agent asks named Gitmoot agents to do
follow-up work. Each entry describes a child job that Gitmoot spawns and tracks.
This is the mechanism that replaced the legacy `next_agents` field: rather than
naming a single hand-off, an agent can request a structured set of child jobs
with dependencies, failure handling, and synthesis rules.

**Orchestra** is gitmoot's name for structured multi-agent delegation: a
conductor (coordinator) returns a `delegations[]` score, the players (child
agents) run in parallel or in dependency order, and a finale (continuation)
reconvenes and synthesizes the results. The vocabulary maps onto the contract
below: the conductor is the coordinator agent; the players are the delegated
child agents; the score is the `delegations[]` DAG (`deps` are the cues); and
the finale is the continuation job that reconvenes and synthesizes. None of the
JSON keys or identifiers change — "Orchestra/orchestrate" is layered on top of
the same `delegations` field, `coordinator`, and `continuation` mechanics.

```json
{
  "gitmoot_result": {
    "decision": "approved",
    "summary": "Plan ready for review.",
    "findings": [],
    "changes_made": [],
    "tests_run": [],
    "needs": [],
    "delegations": [
      {
        "id": "review-plan",
        "agent": "thermo-review",
        "action": "review",
        "prompt": "Review the implementation plan for correctness."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Delegation fields

- `id` (required): a stable identifier for this delegation, unique within the
  result. Sibling delegations reference it through `deps`.
- `agent` (required): the name of the Gitmoot agent to run for the child job.
- `action` (required): the job action — one of `ask`, `review`, or `implement`.
- `prompt` (required): the instructions handed to the delegated job.
- `deps` (optional): an array of sibling delegation `id`s. The delegation runs
  only after every listed sibling job succeeds. Each entry must reference a
  known sibling in the same result, may not be self-referential, and may not
  form a cycle. Delegations form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and cycles are
  rejected at validation time.
- `failure_policy` (optional): one of `block_parent`, `continue`, or `escalate`.
  Defaults to `block_parent` when omitted.
- `synthesis_rule` (optional): one of `summary` or `vote`. It tells the
  coordinator how to combine the children's results.
- `timeout` (optional): a Go duration string that must be positive (for example,
  `10m`).
- `retry` (optional): an integer that must be `>= 0`.
- `worktree` (optional): the worktree path for the child job.
- `artifacts` (optional): named artifact handles passed to the child. When any
  delegation requests `artifacts`, the parent result must also set the top-level
  `artifact_body` field; validation rejects the result otherwise. See
  [Top-level fields](#top-level-fields).
- `fingerprint` (optional): a dedup key. Delegations with identical fingerprints
  are de-duplicated, so the same delegation is not dispatched twice.
- `model` (optional): a free-form, runtime-scoped model string for the child job
  (for example a Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code model name). When omitted, the
  delegated agent's configured default model is used. There is no allow-list;
  Gitmoot passes the value through to the runtime as-is.

### How delegations run

A delegation with no `deps` is dispatched immediately and runs in parallel with
its other dep-free siblings. A delegation that lists `deps` waits until every
sibling it depends on has succeeded before it dispatches. Because the dependency
graph is a DAG, Gitmoot can resolve a clear order without ever looping.

Once every top-level delegation reaches a terminal state, Gitmoot enqueues
exactly one coordinator "continuation" job, sent back to the delegating agent, to
synthesize the children's results according to the `synthesis_rule`. There is
always exactly one continuation per batch of top-level delegations, not one per
child, so the delegating agent gets a single opportunity to consolidate the
outcome.

### Job-tree linkage

Each child job carries linkage fields so any job can be traced through the tree:

- `parent_job_id`: the job that delegated this child.
- `delegation_id`: the `id` of the delegation that produced this child.
- `root_job_id`: the root of the entire delegation tree.
- `delegation_depth`: how deep this job sits below the root.
- `task_id`: the task the tree belongs to.

These fields let Gitmoot connect a child back to its parent, to the specific
delegation that spawned it, and to the root of the job tree, and they are what
the termination bounds below are measured against.

## Top-level fields

- `artifact_body` (optional): the artifact payload made available to delegated
  children. It is required whenever any delegation sets `artifacts`. The two
  fields are coupled: child-facing `artifacts` handles describe what a child can
  reference, and `artifact_body` carries the actual payload at the top level of
  the parent result. Setting `artifacts` without `artifact_body` is rejected by
  validation.

## Termination bounds

Delegation and coordinator-continuation chains are bounded so they cannot recurse
or fan out forever. The bounds are enforced by the workflow engine, and when one
trips, the offending delegations are dropped rather than dispatched.

- **Depth cap (`MaxDelegationDepth = 8`)**: each delegation child and each
  coordinator continuation increments `delegation_depth`. A job at or beyond this
  depth may not delegate further.
- **Per-root job budget (`MaxDelegationTotalJobs = 64`)**: the whole delegation
  tree under one root — all children and continuations sharing that root — is
  capped at this many jobs. When a batch of delegations would exceed the budget,
  it is dropped, and the parent receives a lifecycle event such as "delegation
  tree for root &lt;id&gt; reached the job budget of 64".
- **Loop detection**: a canonical windowed signature over recent delegation
  activity halts repeated or cyclic delegation chains — for example an
  oscillating A→B→A loop — well before the depth cap is reached.

When any bound trips, the offending delegations are dropped (not dispatched) and
the parent receives a lifecycle/mailbox event explaining why. Work is bounded,
not silently retried forever.
