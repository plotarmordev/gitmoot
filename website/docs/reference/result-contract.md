# Agent Result Contract

Every Gitmoot agent job ends by returning a single `gitmoot_result` JSON object.
The result is how an agent reports its outcome, records what it actually did, and
optionally requests follow-up work from other agents. Gitmoot parses this object
after the runtime delivers the agent's output and uses it to drive the rest of
the workflow, so it should be concise, truthful, and tied to work that really
happened.

## The `gitmoot_result` Shape

At a high level the result captures a decision, a short summary, and several
arrays that describe the work:

```json
{
  "gitmoot_result": {
    "decision": "approved|changes_requested|blocked|implemented|failed",
    "summary": "Brief outcome.",
    "findings": [],
    "changes_made": [],
    "tests_run": [],
    "needs": [],
    "delegations": []
  }
}
```

The `decision` field reports the outcome of the job:

- `approved`: a review found no blocking issues.
- `changes_requested`: a review found issues that should be fixed before merge.
- `blocked`: work cannot continue without human input or an external state
  change.
- `implemented`: the requested implementation work was completed.
- `failed`: the attempted action errored or could not complete.

The narrative and evidence fields are reporting-only. Do not claim tests were run
in `tests_run` unless they were actually run, and do not list files in
`changes_made` unless they were actually changed. Use `needs` for missing
credentials, unclear scope, unavailable tools, failing external services, or
required human decisions. Always redact secrets from summaries, findings, raw
command output, and examples.

## Findings

`findings` is a free-form array — each entry may be a plain string or a JSON
object; there is no rigid schema. When you emit **object** findings, the posted
PR/issue comment renders them as readable markdown (a bold heading plus an
indented `key: value` sub-list) instead of an inline JSON blob, so a few
conventional keys make the result easier for humans to audit:

- **Heading**: the renderer uses the first present of `title`, `approach`,
  `name`, `summary`, or `finding` as the bold heading.
- **Qualifier**: the first present of `recommendation`, `severity`, or `status`
  is shown in parentheses next to the heading (e.g. `(PRIMARY)`, `(high)`).
- **Links**: a `source_url`, `url`, or `source` value is rendered as a clickable
  markdown link.
- **Nested values**: arrays become a nested bullet sub-list; nested objects
  render as `key: value` lines (depth-bounded).

None of these keys is mandatory. String findings still render exactly as the
plain text you provide, and any finding the renderer cannot map (for example a
top-level array) falls back to a pretty-printed fenced ```json``` block.

## Delegations (Orchestration)

The `delegations` array is how an agent asks named Gitmoot agents to do
follow-up work. Each entry describes a child job that Gitmoot spawns and tracks.
This is the mechanism that replaced the legacy `next_agents` field: rather than
naming a single hand-off, an agent can request a structured set of child jobs
with dependencies, failure handling, and synthesis rules.

**Orchestra** is gitmoot's name for structured multi-agent delegation: a
conductor (coordinator) returns a `delegations[]` score, the players (child
agents) run in parallel or in dependency order, and a finale (continuation)
reconvenes and synthesizes the results. The vocabulary maps onto the contract
below: the conductor is the coordinator agent; the players are the delegated
child agents; the score is the `delegations[]` DAG (`deps` are the cues); and
the finale is the continuation job that reconvenes and synthesizes. None of the
JSON keys or identifiers change — "Orchestra/orchestrate" is layered on top of
the same `delegations` field, `coordinator`, and `continuation` mechanics.

```json
{
  "gitmoot_result": {
    "decision": "approved",
    "summary": "Plan ready for review.",
    "findings": [],
    "changes_made": [],
    "tests_run": [],
    "needs": [],
    "delegations": [
      {
        "id": "review-plan",
        "agent": "thermo-review",
        "action": "review",
        "prompt": "Review the implementation plan for correctness."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Delegation fields

- `id` (required): a stable identifier for this delegation, unique within the
  result. Sibling delegations reference it through `deps`.
- `agent` (required): the name of the Gitmoot agent to run for the child job.
- `action` (required): the job action — one of `ask`, `review`, or `implement`.
- `prompt` (required): the instructions handed to the delegated job.
- `deps` (optional): an array of sibling delegation `id`s. The delegation runs
  only after every listed sibling job succeeds. Each entry must reference a
  known sibling in the same result, may not be self-referential, and may not
  form a cycle. Delegations form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and cycles are
  rejected at validation time.
- `failure_policy` (optional): one of `block_parent`, `continue`, `escalate`, or
  `escalate_human`. Defaults to `block_parent` when omitted.
  - `block_parent` — a failed child blocks the shared parent task (terminal).
  - `continue` — independent siblings keep running; only this branch's dependents
    are skipped.
  - `escalate` — hand every child outcome to the **coordinator** continuation to
    decide autonomously (no human).
  - `escalate_human` — a **durable human-in-the-loop pause** (#340). On a child
    failure the parent task enters the resumable `awaiting_human` state, **no
    continuation is enqueued, and the tree consumes zero tokens/compute** until a
    human resumes it. The daemon @-tags the human in a GitHub comment (default
    handle: the repo owner, or `[orchestrate].escalation_handle`) and the
    dashboard lists the tree under **Attention**. A human resumes with
    `/gitmoot resume <coordinatorJobID> retry|continue|abort [instructions]`:
    `retry` re-runs the failing leg with the instructions folded in, `continue`
    proceeds the coordinator continuation (now human-approved), and `abort`
    routes to the graceful finalize continuation. A never-answered escalation is
    auto-finalized after `[orchestrate].escalation_ttl` (default 24h); paused
    time is excluded from the per-root wall-clock budget, and a paused tree is
    never counted as a budget failure. The daemon routes `/gitmoot resume`
    comments on the tree's **open** PR or issue (it watches open PRs/issues); the
    dashboard **Attention** section and the `escalation_ttl` backstop cover a tree
    whose PR/issue is no longer open.
- `synthesis_rule` (optional): one of `summary`, `vote`, `quorum`, or `verify`.
  It tells the coordinator how to combine the children's results.
- `quorum` (optional): an integer `K` (`> 0`), required when `synthesis_rule` is
  `quorum`. The coordinator continuation proceeds only if at least `K` children
  reach an approving decision; otherwise the parent blocks, exactly as a failed
  `vote` does. `vote` is the special case where `K` equals the number of
  delegations (every child must approve). `K` is an integer count only — no
  fractions or percentages — and must not exceed the number of delegations (a
  larger `K` is unsatisfiable and is rejected).

  **`verify` — engine-enforced verify→replan (#439).** Where `vote`/`quorum`
  **block** the parent on failure (a terminal dead-end), `verify` does NOT block:
  when every child has resolved, the engine derives a pass/fail **verdict** from
  the `verify`-tagged leg(s) — a verify leg passes iff its decision approves
  (`approved`/`implemented`), and a `changes_requested`/`failed` or missing verify
  leg fails it — and on a **failed** verdict enqueues a single **bounded corrective
  "replan" continuation** (autonomous self-correction) instead of the normal
  synthesis continuation. The verify→replan loop is bounded by a dedicated per-root
  attempt cap (default **2**, configurable via
  `[orchestrate].max_verify_replan_attempts`); on exhaustion it routes to the
  graceful **finalize** continuation like every other backstop, never an unbounded
  loop. All existing structural bounds (depth/width/jobs/wall-clock/token/cost)
  still apply. The verdict is read mechanically from the already-completed verify
  leg (see below): the engine adds **no** new verify subprocess or second model
  call. `verify` requires no `quorum` field. A set that does not tag a `verify` leg
  behaves exactly as before.

  **Produce vs. independent check.** The `synthesis_rule`s above reconcile what
  the producers **self-report** — `summary` merges their summaries, `vote`/`quorum`
  count their *own* approving decisions. That is **self-evaluation**, and it
  inherits the producer's blind spots. To check the *combined* result against the
  original goal independently, add a separate **verify leg**: a read-only ephemeral
  `review` child that `deps` on the producer(s), runs on a **different
  runtime/model**, and re-runs the build and tests itself rather than trusting the
  producers' self-reported `tests_run`. It returns `decision: changes_requested`
  with structured findings on any objective failure, else `approved`. This is
  **cross-evaluation**, which the literature consistently finds beats
  self-evaluation: a capable verifier catches failures the solver does not (the
  generator-verifier gap), and LLM-as-judge graders show a self-preference bias
  toward their own outputs that a different-model judge does not share. It is the
  same separation as [ROMA](https://github.com/sentient-agi/ROMA)'s Verifier
  (`VerifierSignature: (goal, candidate_output) -> verdict + feedback`), where a
  failed verdict drives a re-plan instead of trusting the producer.

  There are **two ways** to drive the failed verdict back into a re-plan:

  - **Template pattern (#421).** Tag the verify leg with `failure_policy: escalate`
    (autonomous correction in the coordinator continuation) or `escalate_human` (a
    human-in-the-loop pause); the **coordinator** hand-rolls the verify→replan loop
    in its continuation. The merge gate independently blocks merge on the non-ready
    decision. The built-in
    [`verifier` and `decompose-and-verify` recipes](../workflows/coordinator-recipes-workflow.md)
    are templates for this — no new engine primitive is involved (`ephemeral`,
    `failure_policy`, and the merge gate already ship).
  - **Engine-enforced rule (#439).** Tag the verify leg with
    `synthesis_rule: verify` (see above). The **engine** derives the verdict from
    the verify leg and, on a fail, enqueues the bounded replan continuation itself —
    so the verify→replan loop and its attempt cap are enforced engine-side rather
    than depending on the coordinator to drive them. Use this when you want the
    self-correction loop guaranteed and bounded by the engine; use the template
    pattern when you want full coordinator control over how the failure is routed.
- `timeout` (optional): a Go duration string that must be positive (for example,
  `10m`).
- `retry` (optional): an integer that must be `>= 0`.
- `worktree` (optional): the worktree path for the child job.
- `artifacts` (optional): named artifact handles passed to the child. When any
  delegation requests `artifacts`, the parent result must also set the top-level
  `artifact_body` field; validation rejects the result otherwise. See
  [Top-level fields](#top-level-fields).
- `fingerprint` (optional): a dedup key. Delegations with identical fingerprints
  are de-duplicated, so the same delegation is not dispatched twice.
- `model` (optional): a free-form, runtime-scoped model string for the child job
  (for example a Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code model name). When omitted, the
  delegated agent's configured default model is used. There is no allow-list;
  Gitmoot passes the value through to the runtime as-is.

  **Model-tier routing (recommendation).** Picking a per-delegation `model` is
  the coordinator's call — Gitmoot does not choose or override it. As a costing
  heuristic, think of each leg as falling into one of four abstract **tiers**,
  then map the tier to a concrete model for whichever runtime the leg uses:

  - **mechanical** — rote, deterministic edits (a rename, a codemod-style
    find-and-replace, a version bump, regenerating a file). Use the smallest /
    cheapest model.
  - **cheap** — low-complexity legs (a short `ask`, a narrow single-file
    lookup). A small, fast model is enough.
  - **standard** — ordinary work with no strong hardness signal. **Leave
    `model` empty** so the leg runs on the delegated agent's runtime default.
  - **deep** — genuinely hard or quorum-critical legs. Reserve a strong,
    expensive model.

  Cheap **hardness signals** a coordinator can read off a leg before dispatch: a
  long, detailed prompt; hard-topic keywords (`architecture`, `oauth`, `schema`,
  `concurrency`, `migration`, `security`, `refactor`, …); a multi-file
  `implement`/`fix` action versus a read-only `ask`; broad scope (several
  `artifacts` or a dedicated `worktree`); and whether the leg is part of a
  `quorum`. More of these lean **deep**; their absence leans **cheap**. Gitmoot
  ships an uncalibrated helper for this — `workflow.ScoreComplexity` /
  `workflow.TierFor` (`internal/workflow/modeltier.go`) — that turns a
  delegation into a tier. It is a pure recommendation primitive: the engine
  never calls it and never overrides a coordinator's chosen `model`.

  **Cascade / escalate-in-continuation pattern.** Prefer to start a leg on the
  cheapest plausible tier and **escalate in a continuation** only if it falls
  short: run the first attempt on a cheap/standard model, and if the result is
  `blocked`/`failed` (or a `quorum` vote is not met), have the coordinator
  re-issue that leg in its next round on a deep model. This keeps the common
  case cheap while still reaching a strong model for the legs that genuinely
  need it.

  **Rule of thumb:** downshift `model` for cheap/mechanical legs; leave `model`
  empty for standard legs (so they take the runtime default); and reserve a deep
  model for genuinely hard or quorum-critical legs.
- `phase` (optional): a free-form per-delegation string. It is pass-through
  metadata — Gitmoot carries it through to the child job untouched and echoes it
  back in the coordinator continuation for each delegation that set a non-empty
  value, so the coordinator can group or label legs (for example `plan`,
  `implement`, `verify`). Like `model`, it is metadata only: it does **not**
  affect scheduling, loop detection, or termination, and it is not part of the
  delegation-set signature used for loop detection. There is no allow-list.
- `ephemeral` (optional): an inline worker spec that spawns a throwaway child
  agent on demand instead of routing to a pre-registered one. It is **mutually
  exclusive** with `agent` — a delegation must set exactly one of `agent` or
  `ephemeral`. When `ephemeral` is set, the coordinator does not need to register
  an agent first: Gitmoot creates a worker from the spec, runs the child job, and
  auto-disposes of the worker once the job finishes. The ephemeral child inherits
  the coordinator's allowed repo scope. The spec has these fields:
  - `runtime` (required): the runtime that backs the worker — one of `codex`,
    `claude`, or `kimi`. It is never `shell`.
  - `model` (optional): a runtime-scoped model string, exactly like the
    delegation `model` field above.
  - `template` (optional): an agent-template id used to seed the worker's prompt.
  - `role` (optional): a human-readable role label for the worker.
  - `capabilities` (optional): an array of capability strings the worker
    advertises.
  - `autonomy_policy` (optional): the worker's sandbox autonomy. Defaults to
    `read-only`.

  Ephemeral delegations are bounded by the same delegation limits as every other
  delegation (see [Termination bounds](#termination-bounds)): they do not relax
  the depth cap, the per-root job budget, or loop detection.

  Ephemeral workers are **leaf-only**: an ephemeral child cannot return its own
  `delegations`. Any delegations it returns are ignored, so it can never fan work
  out further or spawn more workers. If the work itself needs to delegate, route
  it to a registered `agent` instead.

  **`agent` vs `ephemeral` — which to use:** delegate to a registered `agent`
  when the work needs a specific, durable, addressable worker (a tuned or
  SkillOpt-trained template, a resumable session, accountable job history) or
  when the worker must itself delegate — ephemeral workers are leaf-only and
  cannot return their own delegations. Use `ephemeral` for one-off, disposable,
  dynamically-sized fan-out where you just need "a runtime + model + prompt"
  with no pre-registration and no cleanup (for example N workers each producing
  one result, or a cheap gate plus a strong verifier with per-worker models).
  For the longer comparison, including how temp workers fit in, see
  [Choosing a worker](../concepts/agents-templates-jobs-locks.md#choosing-a-worker-registered-agent-vs-ephemeral-worker).

### Validation errors

Each required-field failure is reported per entry as
`delegations[<index>] (id "<id>"): <field> is required`, where `<index>` is the
0-based position in `delegations[]` and `<id>` is the delegation's id (or
`<missing>` when blank). All offending fields across the batch are reported
together — not just the first — and the coordinator gets one repair retry to fix
them all in a single round.

:::tip Built-in coordinator recipes
You do not have to author the `ephemeral` fan-out by hand. The built-in
**coordinator recipes** `review-panel`, `decompose-and-verify`, and `verifier`
are templates that emit a ready-made ephemeral `delegations[]` for you — a
diverse-lens review panel, parallel implementation legs plus a verify gate, or one
producer plus an independent verify leg. Run them with
`gitmoot orchestrate review-panel "..."` /
`gitmoot orchestrate decompose-and-verify "..."` /
`gitmoot orchestrate verifier "..."`. See the
[Coordinator Recipes Workflow](../workflows/coordinator-recipes-workflow.md).
:::

### How delegations run

A delegation with no `deps` is dispatched immediately and runs in parallel with
its other dep-free siblings. A delegation that lists `deps` waits until every
sibling it depends on has succeeded before it dispatches. Because the dependency
graph is a DAG, Gitmoot can resolve a clear order without ever looping.

Sibling children that share the repo run in isolated git worktrees so they do
not serialize on the shared checkout: `implement` children each get their own
branch worktree, and when a coordinator fans out two or more read-only
(`ask`/`review`) children, each gets a throwaway detached worktree (no branch),
disposed automatically when the child finishes. A read-only child that `deps` on
`implement` legs (e.g. a decompose-and-verify verify gate) runs in a detached
worktree with those legs' branches merged in, so it sees their combined work
rather than the base checkout; if the legs are not file-disjoint the merge
conflicts and the parent is blocked. This is internal scheduling — coordinators
do not request it.

Once every top-level delegation reaches a terminal state, Gitmoot enqueues
exactly one coordinator "continuation" job, sent back to the delegating agent, to
synthesize the children's results according to the `synthesis_rule`. There is
always exactly one continuation per batch of top-level delegations, not one per
child, so the delegating agent gets a single opportunity to consolidate the
outcome.

### Job-tree linkage

Each child job carries linkage fields so any job can be traced through the tree:

- `parent_job_id`: the job that delegated this child.
- `delegation_id`: the `id` of the delegation that produced this child.
- `root_job_id`: the root of the entire delegation tree.
- `delegation_depth`: how deep this job sits below the root.
- `task_id`: the task the tree belongs to.

These fields let Gitmoot connect a child back to its parent, to the specific
delegation that spawned it, and to the root of the job tree, and they are what
the termination bounds below are measured against.

## Top-level fields

- `artifact_body` (optional): the artifact payload made available to delegated
  children. It is required whenever any delegation sets `artifacts`. The two
  fields are coupled: child-facing `artifacts` handles describe what a child can
  reference, and `artifact_body` carries the actual payload at the top level of
  the parent result. Setting `artifacts` without `artifact_body` is rejected by
  validation. When the orchestrate policy enables it, a child's `artifact_body`
  can also be **inlined** into the coordinator continuation prompt — appended as a
  fenced block after each child's decision/summary/PR line, size-capped (per body
  and per continuation) and rune-safe truncated, with a marker pointing at the
  full on-disk brief at `<ArtifactRoot>/delegations/<parent>/brief.md`. Inlining
  is **off by default**; see `inline_artifact_bodies` in the
  [cockpit/orchestrate config](../workflows/cockpit-orchestrate-workflow.md#configuration-the-orchestrate-section).
  With it off, the continuation prompt is byte-identical to before.

## Termination bounds

Delegation and coordinator-continuation chains are bounded so they cannot recurse
or fan out forever. The bounds are enforced by the workflow engine, and when one
trips, the offending delegations are dropped rather than dispatched.

- **Depth cap (`MaxDelegationDepth = 8`)**: each delegation child and each
  coordinator continuation increments `delegation_depth`. A job at or beyond this
  depth may not delegate further.
- **Per-root job budget (`MaxDelegationTotalJobs = 64`)**: the whole delegation
  tree under one root — all children and continuations sharing that root — is
  capped at this many jobs. When a batch of delegations would exceed the budget,
  it is dropped, and the parent receives a lifecycle event such as "delegation
  tree for root &lt;id&gt; reached the job budget of 64".
- **Wall-clock budget (`MaxDelegationWallClock = 2h`)**: the whole delegation
  tree under one root is bounded in duration, measured from the root job's
  creation. When a coordinator tries to fan out after the tree has run longer
  than this, the new delegations are dropped and the parent receives a
  `delegation_walltime_exceeded` event. This bounds an expensive-but-not-numerous
  tree (slow agents, long per-job work) that the depth/job-count caps miss. It is
  a generous runaway backstop, not a tight deadline.
- **Per-root token budget / cost (`[orchestrate].max_delegation_token_budget`, off
  by default — `0` = unlimited)**: when set to a positive value, the whole
  delegation tree under one root is bounded by cumulative token usage (input +
  output, summed across every job in the tree). A coordinator that tries to fan
  out after the tree has already used at least the budget is refused with a
  `delegation_cost_exceeded` event and routed through the graceful finalize
  continuation. Token capture is **best-effort per runtime** (see the table
  below), so the budget can under-count a runtime that does not report usage — it
  never over-counts. Leaving the knob at `0` skips the check entirely (behavior is
  byte-identical to before the knob existed).
- **Per-coordinator width (`MaxDelegationWidth = 16`)**: a single coordinator
  result may request at most this many delegations in one generation; a wider set
  is refused with a `delegation_width_exceeded` event and routed through the same
  graceful finalize continuation.
- **Loop detection (two signals)**: a **structural** windowed signature over
  recent delegation sets halts a coordinator that re-issues the same set — for
  example an oscillating A→B→A loop — well before the depth cap is reached. A
  **result-aware non-progress streak** (#339) layers on top to catch a coordinator
  that perturbs the set each round to dodge the structural hash but whose children
  keep returning nothing new: after every generation finishes, the engine
  fingerprints the children's *verifiable* side effects (`decision`,
  `changes_made`, `tests_run`, PR/HeadSHA, `artifact_body` — self-reported
  summary/findings text is deliberately excluded) and trips the loop ladder once
  that digest repeats for `MaxDelegationNonProgressStreak` consecutive generations
  (default `2`, configurable per-host via
  `[orchestrate].max_delegation_non_progress_streak`). Any new durable side effect
  resets the streak even when the summary text repeats. Both signals share one
  ladder: a `delegation_loop_warning` plus a corrective continuation, then
  `delegation_loop_detected` plus the graceful finalize continuation.
- **Operator kill switch**: `gitmoot job kill <root-job-id>` lets an operator
  terminate a runaway tree by its root id from outside. It is the **first**
  backstop, so operator action wins over every budget cap. The kill is graceful —
  in-flight jobs finish normally, the coordinator's next continuation routes
  through the same finalize path below (a `delegation_killed` event is emitted),
  and the daemon stops starting queued children of the killed root.

When any bound trips, the offending delegations are not dispatched and the parent
receives a typed lifecycle event explaining why. Rather than stopping silently,
the engine then enqueues one **graceful finalize continuation**
(`delegation_finalize_enqueued`): the coordinator is told it cannot delegate
further and asked to synthesize a best-effort final result and return empty
delegations. That continuation is terminal — any delegations it returns are
ignored (`delegation_finalized`). Work is bounded and always ends with a clean
synthesis, not a silent dead end.

### Token-capture status (per runtime)

The per-root **token budget** sums whatever usage each job's runtime reports at
delivery time. Capture is best-effort and uneven across runtimes; a job whose
runtime reports no usage contributes `0`, so the budget **under-counts** rather
than failing:

| Runtime | Reports token usage? | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | Yes | Parsed from `usage.{input,output}_tokens` of the `--output-format json` envelope. |
| **Kimi Code** | Best-effort | Captured if the `--output-format stream-json` stream emits a `usage` object; otherwise `0`. |
| **Codex** | No (contributes `0`) | Delivery runs `codex exec resume … -- <prompt>` without `--json` (plain text), so no machine-readable usage is exposed. |

Because of this, a tree made up mostly of Codex jobs accumulates little or no
counted usage — set the budget accordingly and treat it as a coarse runaway-cost
backstop, not a precise spend limit. A `$`-denominated price table is not
implemented yet; the budget is in raw tokens.
