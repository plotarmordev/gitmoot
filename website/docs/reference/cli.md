# Gitmoot CLI Reference

Use these commands from an agent session only when the user asks for Gitmoot
setup, status, agent coordination, or PR-comment workflow help.

## Install And Update

```sh
curl -fsSL https://gitmoot.io/install.sh | sh
gitmoot version
gitmoot update --check
gitmoot update --restart-daemon
gitmoot doctor [--repo <path>]
```

Verify GitHub access before PR workflows:

```sh
gh auth status
```

`gitmoot doctor` is the environment preflight: it validates `gh auth` (with an
actionable remediation hint) and the runtime credentials — including a
daemon-aware live probe of the Claude token — so a bad credential is caught
before jobs stall on it. Run it after install and before starting the daemon.

One-shot onboarding: `gitmoot setup` registers the repo and an agent in one
command (`--repo owner/repo --agent <name> --runtime codex|claude|shell
--session <ref> [--role <role>] [--path .] [--start-daemon]`). `--repo`,
`--agent`, `--runtime`, and `--session` are all **required** — setup errors out
if any is missing; `--session` takes a runtime session reference, `last`, or a
shell command.
`--watch-issues` is **on by default** in setup, so the daemon comes up
tagging-ready for `@<agent>` issue mentions.

## Home And Config

Local state lives in the Gitmoot home (default `~/.gitmoot`): the SQLite store,
`logs/`, `workspaces/`, `evals/`, `artifact_blobs/`, and `config.toml`.

```sh
gitmoot init            # create the Gitmoot home
gitmoot config path     # print the config file location
gitmoot config show     # print the effective config
```

Set the `GITMOOT_HOME` environment variable (or pass the global `--home <path>`
flag, accepted by nearly every command) to relocate everything — useful for
isolated test homes.

## Runtime Plugins

Install Gitmoot's Agent Skill into Codex or Claude Code when the user wants the
runtime to discover Gitmoot workflow guidance from its plugin system:

```sh
gitmoot plugin install codex
gitmoot plugin install claude
gitmoot plugin doctor
```

Inspect or build packages without installing:

```sh
gitmoot plugin build codex
gitmoot plugin build claude
gitmoot plugin path codex
gitmoot plugin path claude
gitmoot plugin doctor codex
gitmoot plugin doctor claude
gitmoot plugin codex-launch --repo .
gitmoot plugin codex-launch --config-snippet
```

Claude scopes are supported with `--scope user|project|local`. Codex ignores
`--scope` because the current Codex plugin install command does not use it.
Use `plugin codex-launch` when Codex needs sandbox access to the resolved
Gitmoot home on Linux, macOS, or Windows. It prints a `codex-face --cd ...
--add-dir ... -s workspace-write` launch command, or a persistent config
snippet with `--config-snippet`.

## Repo And Daemon Status

```sh
gitmoot status --repo owner/repo
gitmoot events --repo owner/repo
gitmoot daemon start --poll 30s --workers 1
gitmoot daemon start --session <root-job-id>
gitmoot daemon start
gitmoot daemon status
gitmoot daemon logs
gitmoot daemon restart
gitmoot daemon stop [--forget-runtime-auth]
```

For structured local state, use `gitmoot dashboard --json` or
`gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo --json`. `gitmoot status --json` and
`gitmoot task show` are not valid commands.

### Watched Repos

```sh
gitmoot repo add owner/repo --path <path> [--poll 30s]
gitmoot repo list
gitmoot repo remove owner/repo
gitmoot repo doctor owner/repo
```

The `gitmoot repo` commands manage the **watched-repo registry**: one daemon
per Gitmoot home supervises every **enabled** registered repo (each with its
own `--poll` interval). `repo doctor owner/repo` checks a single repo's
checkout/config health.

Use `daemon start` for the background daemon. Use `daemon run` only when the
user explicitly wants a foreground process. Keep the default `--workers 1`
unless the Gitmoot home has multiple independent runtime sessions or managed
agent types with `max_background` greater than one.

`daemon start --repo owner/repo` **scopes** the daemon to a single repo: it
polls only that repo's PRs and claims only that repo's queued jobs. Omit
`--repo` to supervise every enabled registered repo from one daemon (#581). Do
not start one daemon per repo on the same home expecting parallel isolation: a
second daemon on the same home is **refused** (`daemon already running with pid
…`; a stale pidfile from a dead owner is liveness-checked, so restarts work
cleanly). To cap one repo's parallelism on a shared (no-`--repo`) daemon, use
the per-repo config keys below instead.

Both `daemon run` and `daemon start` accept `--session <root-job-id>` (alias
`--root`) to pin the worker to one orchestration run. With `--session` set, the
worker runs only jobs whose `root_job_id` matches that value plus the root
coordinator job itself, and ignores every other queued job. Leaving it empty
keeps the default behavior of matching all jobs.

Both `daemon run` and `daemon start` also accept three opt-in flags (all off by
default, so leaving them unset is byte-identical to before): `--watch-issues`
watches open **issues** for `@<agent> ask …` mentions and routes them to jobs,
mirroring the PR-comment watcher; `--scheduler pool` selects the continuous
worker-pool scheduler that re-queries the queue as workers free and auto-isolates
a contended same-repo read job into an ephemeral worktree (fixing a same-repo
dependent-job deadlock), versus the default `--scheduler barrier`;
`--watch-skillopt-reviews` polls watched SkillOpt review issue comments and
imports valid feedback automatically.

To run a repo's queued jobs N-wide, use `--parallel N` (sugar for `--workers N
--scheduler pool`; it cannot be combined with `--workers` or `--scheduler`).
Raising `--workers` above 1 without an explicit `--scheduler` now **auto-selects
`pool`**, since multiple workers under `barrier` serialize same-repo jobs anyway;
an explicit `--scheduler barrier` is still honored. `gitmoot daemon status`
reports the live scheduler mode and worker count (e.g. `scheduler: pool, workers:
5`), and the daemon logs a preflight warning — with the exact relaunch command —
when ≥2 parallelizable jobs are queued under a serializing config. Same-repo
parallelism is bounded by **distinct runtime sessions** as well as distinct
checkouts; see [Run Jobs In Parallel On A Repo](../workflows/parallel-jobs-workflow.md).
One repo's concurrency can also be capped **from config, without any relaunch**,
via a `[repos."owner/repo"]` section with `max_parallel = N` (#576) — see
[Cap one repo's parallelism from config](../workflows/parallel-jobs-workflow.md#cap-one-repos-parallelism-from-config).

### Reconfigure Without Restarting

`kill -HUP <daemon-pid>` re-reads the `[daemon]` config section (`poll`,
`workers`, `scheduler`, parallelism) live (#577) — no teardown, no dropped
jobs, no environment re-inheritance. Values pinned by explicit launch flags win
over the re-read config. Prefer SIGHUP over a restart when only tuning
throughput.

### Runtime Auth Across Restarts

The daemon persists its Claude token into an owner-only (0600)
`daemon-runtime.env` file in the Gitmoot home (#578/#588). `gitmoot daemon
restart` recovers that token even when the invoking shell lacks
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`; a plain `daemon stop` + `daemon start` does **not**
recover it (start re-inherits the launching shell's environment). A recovered
token may be stale — verify with `gitmoot doctor`. A (re)start that would come
up without Claude auth warns loudly on stderr (non-fatal). `gitmoot daemon stop
--forget-runtime-auth` deletes the persisted file so a later restart cannot
recover the token.

`gitmoot dashboard` shows local state — daemon health, repos, agents and runtime
sessions, jobs by state, worktrees, branch locks, SkillOpt train phase/candidate,
and pending interactive prompts.

On a real terminal (stdin and stdout both a TTY) and with no other output/mutation
flag, `gitmoot dashboard` launches an **interactive TUI**: a sidebar of pages
(Attention, Activity, Trains, Agents, Workers, Jobs, Locks, Health, Config)
that auto-refreshes.
Navigate with `tab`/`shift+tab` or `←/→`; `↑/↓` selects a row; `?` opens a
per-page key reference; `r` refreshes, `q` quits. The TUI is the cockpit — every
page can act, and each action runs the same store/workflow code as its CLI
equivalent:

- **Attention** lists pending prompts (`a` answer inline, `d` dismiss) and the
  actual blocked/failed/cancelled jobs with their latest event message
  (`enter` detail, `R` retry, `B` report bug). A red banner appears when the
  daemon is stopped; `s` restarts it with its previously persisted flags.
- **Activity** shows the **live orchestras**: each active delegation root with
  its children, so "what are my agents working on right now" is answered at a
  glance; `enter` opens the request/result detail of a root or a specific
  delegate.
- **Trains** lists every train session: `enter` opens ANY session's live phase
  view (not just the newest), `s` stops a live session (a reason is required;
  same path as `skillopt train stop`), `d` deletes a finished session and its
  history — and, if gitmoot created GitHub repos for that session, a second
  confirm offers to delete those too (never offered for repos gitmoot did not
  create; a missing `delete_repo` token scope shows its `gh auth refresh`
  remedy and can be retried in place).
- **Agents** lists registered agents: `enter` opens a detail with the template,
  recent jobs, and the template's version history — in the detail `↑/↓` selects a
  recent job (then a version) and `enter` opens it: a recent job opens that job's
  detail (`esc` returns), and the list scrolls when an agent has many jobs; `n`
  registers a new agent
  (name, codex/claude/kimi runtime, installed template); `o` starts a training
  session for the agent's template via a pre-filled form (review/workspace
  repos, request, codex/claude backend, optional model — the backend/model are
  stored in the session's optimizer defaults so `train continue` inherits
  them), then drops into the live phase view; `D` deletes the agent (refused
  while jobs reference it); `v` in the detail reverts the template to a
  previous version (same as `gitmoot agent template revert`).
- **Jobs** lists every job with a state summary: `enter` shows the event
  history, `R` retries failed/blocked/cancelled jobs (same path as
  `gitmoot job retry`), `c` cancels queued AND running jobs (same as
  `gitmoot job cancel`; running ones show `cancelling…` until the daemon
  settles them), and `B` opens a redacted bug-report preview for
  failed/blocked/cancelled jobs. In the preview, `g` creates or reuses the
  GitHub issue and keeps the issue URL visible.
- **Locks** explains and lists locks, stale resource locks first in red (the
  owning process died; a running daemon reclaims them automatically); active
  locks collapse to a count. Branch locks are released with
  `gitmoot lock release owner/repo <branch> --owner <agent>`.
- **Workers** lists runtime workers (agent sessions). **Health** shows the
  daemon block (running state, persisted flags, log error tail) plus
  environment checks. **Config** renders the effective config with inline
  edits for scalar fields (or `$EDITOR` for the full file).

Form questions are also published as interactive prompt records, so an agent can
answer them with `gitmoot interactive answer` while the form is open. Inline
answers/dismissals use the same store APIs as `gitmoot interactive answer` /
`clear`.

Everywhere else — pipes, redirects, CI, `--plain`, `--json`, `--all`, `--watch`,
`--answer`, `--dismiss` — it prints the one-shot snapshot instead, unchanged. Set
`GITMOOT_NO_TUI=1` or `TERM=dumb` to force the non-interactive path globally.

```sh
gitmoot dashboard                  # interactive TUI on a terminal
gitmoot dashboard --plain          # one-shot snapshot on a terminal
gitmoot dashboard --json
gitmoot dashboard --all
gitmoot dashboard --answer <prompt-id> --value <value>
gitmoot dashboard --dismiss <prompt-id>
gitmoot dashboard --watch          # plain redraw until Ctrl-C (terminal only)
gitmoot dashboard --watch --interval 2s
gitmoot dashboard --web [--addr 127.0.0.1:8080]
```

In the one-shot styled output the dashboard leads with a "needs attention" block,
colors and truncates long lists, and groups near-identical runtime sessions;
`--all` shows everything. `--watch` redraws on an interval (default 5s) and cannot
be combined with `--json`, `--answer`, or `--dismiss`.

`gitmoot dashboard --web` serves the **read-only web dashboard** until
interrupted: a live orchestration/delegation graph with run summaries and
prompt/output inspection — the browser view of a running orchestration.
`--addr` sets the listen address (default `127.0.0.1:8080`). To expose it
beyond localhost, bind to an internal address and put an authenticating
reverse proxy in front — the dashboard itself has no authentication.

## Bug Reports

Use `gitmoot report bug` to build a redacted GitHub-ready issue from local
Gitmoot error state. Job reports are fully supported; daemon, dashboard, and
train selectors are reserved and return clear unsupported-source errors until
their source collectors are implemented.

```sh
gitmoot report bug --job <job-id> [--preview]
gitmoot report bug --job <job-id> --create --yes
gitmoot report bug --source daemon --preview
gitmoot report bug --source dashboard --preview
gitmoot report bug --train <session-id> --create --yes
```

Default behavior is preview. Agents should run preview first, show or summarize
the redacted draft, and create an issue only when the user explicitly asks or
the active workflow policy already permits filing reports. Non-interactive
creation requires `--create --yes`.

Created reports target `plotarmordev/gitmoot`, include the labels
`gitmoot-dashboard-report` and `bug`, and carry a fingerprint marker in the
body so duplicate open issues can be reused instead of creating another report.
If duplicate search fails in the CLI path, Gitmoot prints a warning and still
creates the issue; dashboard creates fail closed and keep the preview open so
the user can retry.

After creation, report the printed issue URL back to the user. If Gitmoot says
an existing issue was found, report that URL instead of presenting it as a new
issue.

## Agent Setup

Start a new runtime session managed by Gitmoot:

```sh
gitmoot agent start reviewer \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --path . \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review \
  --model gpt-5-codex \
  --start-daemon
```

`agent start`, `agent subscribe`, and `agent type set` accept an optional
`--model <name>` flag that sets the agent's default runtime model. It is a
free-form, runtime-scoped string (a Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code model name)
with no allow-list; both `--model X` and `--model=X` are accepted. A per-job
`--model` (or a delegation's `model` field) overrides this default, and an
omitted model preserves the runtime's own default. The same default can be set
in config under `[agents.<type>].model`.

`agent start` and `agent subscribe` accept `--policy` (default `auto`). The policy
maps to the runtime permission mode and decides what a headless job may do:

| `--policy` | Claude `--permission-mode` | Headless capability |
|---|---|---|
| `read-only` | `plan` | inspect/report only, no writes |
| `workspace-write` | `acceptEdits` | file edits only — does NOT unblock Bash (`go`/`git`/`gh`) |
| `danger-full-access` | `bypassPermissions` | full implementation: file writes plus Bash |
| `auto` (default) | *(no flag)* | non-deterministic — inherited from ambient Claude config |

Because of this, an agent that carries the `implement` capability **must** be
started/subscribed with a write policy. Gitmoot fails closed: `--capability
implement` with `auto`/empty or `read-only` is refused at `agent start`, `agent
subscribe`, and at implement-job dispatch with an actionable message. Set
`--policy danger-full-access` for full headless implementation (file writes plus
`go`/`git`/`gh`), or `--policy workspace-write` for edits-only (Bash stays
blocked). `read-only`/`ask`/`review` agents are unaffected.

`--runtime` accepts `codex`, `claude`, `kimi`, or `kimi-cli`. Kimi Code is a
first-class runtime adapter alongside Codex and Claude Code; `kimi` targets the
current Kimi Code CLI (stream-json output) while `kimi-cli` is the opt-in
legacy Kimi CLI adapter (#546) — choose `kimi` unless you specifically run the
legacy CLI. The two count as the same runtime *family* for cross-family review.
Before starting a Kimi-backed agent, authenticate the Kimi CLI with
`kimi login`, then restart the Gitmoot daemon so it inherits the logged-in
session:

```sh
kimi login
gitmoot daemon restart
gitmoot agent start reviewer \
  --runtime kimi \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --path . \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review
```

A Kimi agent's runtime reference must be a Kimi session id (`session_<uuid>`)
or empty; Gitmoot parses the session id from the Kimi CLI's stream-json output.

Subscribe an existing runtime session:

```sh
gitmoot agent subscribe reviewer \
  --runtime codex \
  --session <session-id-or-last> \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review \
  --model gpt-5-codex
```

`agent subscribe` additionally accepts `--runtime shell`, the deterministic
no-LLM adapter whose `--session` is a **command** (the job prompt arrives as
`$1`; stdout must carry the `gitmoot_result` envelope) — useful for
deterministic end-to-end tests.

Inspect and manage agents:

```sh
gitmoot agent list
gitmoot agent show reviewer
gitmoot agent show reviewer --json
gitmoot agent repos reviewer
gitmoot agent allow reviewer --repo owner/other-repo
gitmoot agent deny reviewer --repo owner/other-repo
gitmoot agent doctor reviewer
gitmoot agent restart reviewer
gitmoot agent remove reviewer
```

`gitmoot agent restart <name>` abandons the agent's runtime session and binds a
fresh one **in place** — the fix for a dead or stranded session that would
otherwise tempt a re-register. It refuses while the session is live or the
agent has in-flight jobs (finish or cancel those first). `gitmoot agent remove
<name>` unregisters the agent.

Delegate to a registered agent from the current local chat:

```sh
gitmoot agent run project-planner --repo owner/repo "Return the plan status."
gitmoot agent run lead --repo owner/repo --task task-001 --background "Implement this task."
gitmoot agent run reviewer --repo owner/repo --pr 12 --background "Review this PR."
gitmoot agent review reviewer --repo owner/repo --pr 12 "Review this PR."
gitmoot agent implement lead --repo owner/repo --task task-001 "Implement this task."
gitmoot agent ask project-planner --repo owner/repo "Return the plan status."
gitmoot agent ask project-planner --repo owner/repo --background "Write the implementation plan and goal file."
gitmoot agent run lead --repo owner/repo --model gpt-5-codex "Implement this task."
gitmoot job watch <job-id>
```

`gitmoot agent run`, `ask`, `implement`, and `review` (and `orchestrate`) accept
an optional `--model <name>` flag that pins the runtime model for that one job,
overriding the agent's configured default. It is a free-form, runtime-scoped
string (a Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code model name) with no allow-list; an
omitted `--model` leaves the agent's default model in effect. Both `--model X`
and `--model=X` are accepted.

The same commands accept an optional per-job `--runtime
codex|claude|kimi|kimi-cli|shell` override: that ONE job runs through the named
runtime while the agent's registered default runtime stays untouched (`agent
show` is unchanged afterwards). An overridden job never resumes — and never
writes back to — the agent's default-runtime session: it runs on a fresh
session of the override runtime, or on an explicit `--session <ref>` (a
Codex/Claude session id, a Kimi session id, or — required for `shell` — a
command; `last` is rejected because it resumes whichever session is most
recent rather than a concrete one), and its runtime-session lock names the
override runtime so it cannot collide with the default session's lock. Model
rule: `--model` combined with `--runtime` is interpreted for the OVERRIDE
runtime; an override without `--model` uses the override runtime's default
model — the agent's configured default model is never applied to a different
runtime. An unknown
`--runtime` fails before any job is enqueued, background (daemon) jobs honor
the override identically to foreground, and a coordinator's delegation-tree
continuations (synthesis, corrective, replan, finalize) inherit the override,
so an `orchestrate --runtime` tree stays on the override runtime across
generations:

```sh
# Retry a hard review through Claude without re-registering the reviewer:
gitmoot agent review reviewer --repo owner/repo --pr 123 "Re-review this PR." --runtime claude
gitmoot agent ask reviewer "Compare the approaches." --repo owner/repo --runtime kimi --model kimi-k2
```

`gitmoot orchestrate`, `agent run`, and `agent implement` also accept an optional
`--skip-native-review-fanout` flag. By default an `implement` job that opens a
pull request fans the PR out to Gitmoot's native reviewers (the configured
required reviewers, or the ones passed for the task). With
`--skip-native-review-fanout` set, the coordinator owns review orchestration
instead: the implement→PR step still records the PR baseline, runs the merge
gate, and records the `implemented` decision, but it enqueues **no** native
review jobs. The skip is honored on both PR-open paths — the engine's
implement-advance and the daemon's GitHub PR-watcher — so a PR opened either way
stays free of native review fan-out. The flag defaults off; leave it off for the
full native review fan-out, which is byte-identical to prior behavior.

When a synchronous `agent implement`/`run`/`ask`/`review`/`orchestrate` job
delivers and **succeeds terminally** but a benign *post-success* advancement step
errors — for example a merge-gate block on the freshly-opened PR, or a 422
"a pull request already exists" race — the command no longer discards the result.
It **exits 0** with the agent result on stdout (in JSON mode this includes an
additive `advance_error` field carrying the advance warning, omitted when there
is none), prints `advance warning: …` to stderr, and shows an `advance_error:`
line in human output. Genuine non-terminal failures (the job did not reach
`succeeded`) still exit non-zero as before. A normal success with no advance error
is byte-identical to prior behavior — no `advance_error` field is emitted.

Start an orchestra of agents with `gitmoot orchestrate`:

```sh
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Plan and split this work across agents." --repo owner/repo
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Plan and split this work." --repo owner/repo --model gpt-5-codex
gitmoot orchestrate project-planner "Review PR #123 in this repo." --repo owner/repo --recipe review-panel
```

`gitmoot orchestrate <agent> "..." [--repo R] [--recipe id]` is sugar for
`gitmoot agent run <agent> --background "..."`. It starts a conductor
(coordinator) that returns a `delegations[]` score; the players (child agents)
then run in parallel or in dependency order, and a finale (continuation)
reconvenes and synthesizes the results.
`--recipe review-panel|decompose-and-verify|verifier` (#477, also accepted on
`agent run`) routes the coordinator through a named built-in recipe prompt
without changing the agent's identity — see
[Coordinator Recipes](../workflows/coordinator-recipes-workflow.md).

This uses the same agent registry, repo access grants, cached template snapshot,
runtime adapter, and local job history as PR-comment jobs. `agent run` is the
default coordinator-safe entrypoint because it routes to `ask`, `review`, or
`implement` and keeps branch, worktree, commit, push, PR, and workflow lifecycle
inside Gitmoot. `agent ask` is for analysis, planning, and questions only; it is
read-only, so when the message reads like branch/commit/push/PR orchestration it
prints a non-fatal note and still runs (pass `--force` to suppress the note).
The runtime
plugin helps Codex or Claude Code discover Gitmoot guidance, but it does not
replace the Gitmoot CLI. Synchronous jobs and queued jobs both use the same
runtime session locks.

Configure managed background agent types:

```sh
gitmoot agent type list
gitmoot agent type show planner
gitmoot agent type set planner --runtime codex --template planner --max-background 2 --idle-timeout 20m
gitmoot agent type set planner --model gpt-5-codex
gitmoot agent gc
```

`agent type set --model <name>` (or `[agents.<type>].model` in config) sets the
default runtime model for that managed agent type.

Schedule recurring agent work (heartbeats, off by default):

```sh
gitmoot agent heartbeat add repo-maintainer daily-status \
  --repo owner/repo --interval 24h --prompt "Daily status report." --enabled
gitmoot agent heartbeat list [--agent <agent>]
gitmoot agent heartbeat show repo-maintainer daily-status
gitmoot agent heartbeat enable|disable repo-maintainer daily-status
gitmoot agent heartbeat remove repo-maintainer daily-status
```

A heartbeat enqueues a normal background job on its `interval` (read-only `ask`
or `review` action; `review` needs the agent's `review` capability). `gitmoot
daemon status` surfaces each schedule's last-run/next-due/last-status. See
[Heartbeat Schedules](../workflows/heartbeat-schedules-workflow.md) for the
full reference.

A registered single instance **shadows** a managed type of the same name:
dispatch resolves `gitmoot agent <name>` to a registered single instance before a
type, so force the type with `--type <name>` (or do not register a single
instance of that name). Since **v0.5.1** a foreground `gitmoot agent ask <type>`
(the `ask` action) dispatches to the managed type synchronously; background
`run`/`review`/`implement` to a type and `[parallel_sessions]` temp-session
forking use the **background** path. See [Running one agent's jobs
concurrently](../concepts/agents-templates-jobs-locks.md#running-one-agents-jobs-concurrently).

## Agent Templates

Install or refresh the built-in thermo review template:

```sh
gitmoot agent template update thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review
gitmoot agent start thermo-review \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --template thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review \
  --start-daemon
```

Install or refresh the built-in full planner/goal template:

```sh
gitmoot agent template update planner
gitmoot agent start project-planner \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --path . \
  --template planner \
  --start-daemon
```

For fast current-chat planning, use the Gitmoot skill with the same packaged
`agent-templates/planner.md` instructions instead of starting a background job:

```text
Use the Gitmoot planner here. Write the implementation plan.
```

The current chat can also import any cached custom agent or template prompt:

```sh
gitmoot agent prompt frontend-reviewer
gitmoot agent prompt frontend-reviewer --json
```

This prints the prompt content for the current chat to apply locally. It does
not create a job, start a daemon, resume a runtime session, or post a PR
comment.

Draft and validate a captured template before installing it:

```sh
gitmoot agent template draft release-planner
gitmoot agent template validate .gitmoot/templates/release-planner.md
gitmoot agent template add release-planner --file .gitmoot/templates/release-planner.md
```

`agent template draft` only creates the standard markdown structure. For
current-chat capture, the active Codex or Claude chat reads
`references/TEMPLATE_CAPTURE.md` and fills that structure from visible
conversation context. Gitmoot does not extract hidden runtime memory.

Create a local custom prompt template:

```sh
mkdir -p agents
gitmoot agent template draft frontend-reviewer --output agents/frontend-reviewer.md
$EDITOR agents/frontend-reviewer.md
gitmoot agent template validate agents/frontend-reviewer.md
gitmoot agent template add frontend-reviewer --file agents/frontend-reviewer.md
gitmoot agent start frontend-reviewer \
  --runtime codex \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --template frontend-reviewer \
  --role reviewer \
  --capability ask \
  --capability review
```

After editing a local template file, refresh Gitmoot's cached snapshot:

```sh
gitmoot agent template diff frontend-reviewer
gitmoot agent template update frontend-reviewer
```

Template updates are versioned locally. `gitmoot agent template show <id>`
prints the current version, content hash, source commit, and promotion state.
Agents use the current promoted version by default, or a pinned version when
configured with a reference such as `--template frontend-reviewer@v1`.

A bad promotion can be undone: `gitmoot agent template revert <template-id>
--version <version-id>` makes a superseded version current again (the dashboard's
Agents page does the same with `v` in the agent detail).
Queued jobs keep the exact template content snapshot they were created with.

Discover templates by metadata:

```sh
gitmoot agent template list --runtime codex --output goal_file
gitmoot agent template list --tag review --capability ask

### Back Up And Share Templates Via GitHub

Templates can be backed up to and pulled from a GitHub repo (#476):

```sh
gitmoot agent template export [<id>...] [--all] [--to <dir>] [--dry-run]
gitmoot agent template publish [<id>...] [--all] [--repo <owner/repo>] [--path <subdir>] [--ref <branch>] [--message <msg>] [--create] [--dry-run]
gitmoot agent template pull [<id>...] [--all] [--repo <owner/repo>] [--ref <ref>] [--path <subdir>] [--dry-run]
gitmoot agent template add <id> --from-repo <owner/repo> [--ref <ref>] [--path <file>]
gitmoot agent template remote set <owner/repo> [--ref <ref>] [--path <subdir>]
gitmoot agent template remote show
```

`export` writes template `.md` files to a local directory; `publish` commits
them to a GitHub repo (`--create` creates a missing repo); `pull` installs or
refreshes templates from that repo; `add --from-repo` installs a single
template file directly from a repo. `remote set` stores a default remote in the
`[template_remote]` config section (`repo`; `ref` defaults to `main`; `path`
defaults to `templates`) so publish/pull/add can omit `--repo`; with no remote
configured, those commands require an explicit `--repo`. **Caution: templates
are stored and published VERBATIM (prompt body + metadata) — point the remote
at a PRIVATE repo unless the prompts are meant to be public.** See the
[template capture workflow](../workflows/template-capture-workflow.md#back-up-and-share-templates-via-github)
for the full flow.

## Goals

Print the standard Gitmoot goal prompt template:

```sh
gitmoot goal template
```

Import a goal file into local Gitmoot state:

```sh
gitmoot goal import --file GOAL-feature.md --repo owner/repo
```

Start a task in its dedicated branch worktree and inspect task state:

```sh
gitmoot task run task-001 --repo owner/repo --owner lead --base main
gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo
gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo --state implementing --json
```

`task run` stores the deterministic task worktree path under
`$GITMOOT_HOME/worktrees/<owner>--<repo>/<task-id>/` and leaves the registered
checkout on its current branch.

## PR Comments

Use GitHub PR comments as the public audit trail:

```text
/gitmoot help
/gitmoot status
/gitmoot <agent> review [instructions]
/gitmoot <agent> implement [instructions]
/gitmoot ask <agent> [question]
/gitmoot retry <job-id>
/gitmoot cancel <job-id>
/gitmoot merge
/gitmoot resume <job-id> retry|continue|abort|answer [instructions]
@<agent> ask|review|implement [instructions]
```

A bare `@<agent> <action> …` mention on a PR comment (or, with the daemon's
`--watch-issues` flag, an issue comment) is treated as the same command as the
`/gitmoot <agent> <action>` form (#389). `/gitmoot resume <jobID>
retry|continue|abort|answer` resumes a delegation tree paused by
`escalate_human` or an ask-gate `human_questions` pause — see the
[result contract](result-contract.md) for the pause/resume semantics. See also
the [PR comment workflow](../workflows/pr-comment-workflow.md).

## Jobs And Locks

```sh
gitmoot job list --repo owner/repo   # add --json for machine-readable rows
gitmoot job show <job-id>            # add --json for the full job + why-stuck detail
gitmoot job watch <job-id>
gitmoot job events <job-id>
gitmoot job run <job-id>
gitmoot job retry <job-id>
gitmoot job cancel <job-id>
gitmoot job kill <root-job-id>
gitmoot lock list --repo owner/repo
gitmoot lock show owner/repo <branch>
```

For a `queued` or `blocked` job, `gitmoot job list` appends a `WHY:` column and
`gitmoot job show` prints a `why_stuck:` (and, when a lease applies, a
`next_retry_at:`) line explaining what the job is waiting on — e.g. `waiting on
runtime session lock runtime:codex:<ref> (held by job <id>)`, `blocked: awaiting
human`, `auth failing: …`, `throttled: …`, or `retrying: …` (#552). The reason
is derived from the most authoritative existing signal (the latest
reason-bearing `job events` entry plus the owning resource lock's lease); a
healthy job's output is unchanged.

Operational blockers auto-retry (#532): a delivery failure classified as
`runtime_auth` or `runtime_quota` does **not** fail the job terminally — the
daemon re-queues it as **deferred** with a bounded retry budget and a hold
until the earliest retry time. `gitmoot job show --json` carries the
`blocker_class` and attempt count, and over the `[events]` stream a
`job.deferred` follows the `job.failed` (making it non-terminal; see the
[event stream](event-stream.md)). A job that "failed then reappeared as queued"
is the deferral working, not a bug.

Jobs stuck in `running` are backstopped too: a running job with no lease
progress past the staleness window (default 30m) is assumed orphaned by a dead
worker and recovered/re-queued. The window is tunable via the
`GITMOOT_STALE_RUNNING_AFTER` environment variable; the smallest honored value
is 1m — below-1m, malformed, or non-positive values are rejected (with a
one-time warning) in favor of the 30m default rather than clamped (#560).

`gitmoot job kill <root-job-id>` is the operator kill switch for a runaway
delegation tree: it terminates the tree identified by its **root** job id
gracefully. In-flight jobs finish normally; the coordinator's next continuation
is routed through the graceful finalize path (synthesize what completed → stop)
and the daemon stops starting queued children of that root. See the
[termination bounds](result-contract.md#termination-bounds) for how it relates
to the other delegation backstops.

`gitmoot job cancel <job-id>` also releases any resource locks the cancelled job
still owned — including a stranded `runtime:<rt>:<session>` lock left behind when
a foreground `gitmoot agent ask` was killed — so the next ask on that agent does
not wait out the lock TTL before it can run.

Merge-gate retries are automatic while the daemon is running. Retryable states,
such as a busy base-branch merge queue or a GitHub branch update in progress,
are retried on the next daemon poll tick. The default poll interval is `30s`
unless the daemon was started with a different `--poll`. When an **external**
system owns the merge decision, set `GITMOOT_DISABLE_NATIVE_MERGE_GATE=1`
(also `true`/`yes`/`on`; #545): Gitmoot then **abstains** from its native merge
gate — fail-closed, it never merges gatelessly; the external gate makes the
call.

## Interactive Prompts

Pending interactive prompts (dashboard form questions, ask-gate questions) can
be answered from the CLI:

```sh
gitmoot interactive list [--state pending|resolved|all] [--json]
gitmoot interactive show <id> --json
gitmoot interactive answer <id> <value> [--source source]
gitmoot interactive clear <id> [<id>...] | --resolved | --all
```

```

On a real terminal, `skillopt train run` opens an interactive view of one session
(resolved from `--session` or the newest session of a `--config`): a phase bar
plus a single keypress per step — `enter` advances the current phase (the long
generate/optimizer steps run in a detached background process so `q` leaves the
run going), `p`/`x` promote or reject a candidate, `n` starts the next iteration.
Review-blocked phases show the GitHub issue link to continue from the browser.
`--plain`, a piped stdin, or `GITMOOT_NO_TUI`/`TERM=dumb` print a one-shot status
snapshot instead. `train status`/`continue` print a `continue_from_github:` line
at review-blocked phases. `train start --create-repos` (or the prompt in the
`train init` form) creates a missing target/workspace/review repo on GitHub.

Use `skillopt train` for the product workflow. It pins the template version,
tracks sessions and iterations, validates item diversity, generates temporary
agent options, publishes review packets, syncs feedback, hands off to the
external optimizer, imports pending candidates, publishes candidate review
context, and starts follow-up iterations only after a promoted/rejected/abandoned
decision. Use `skillopt review`, `feedback`, `export`, `import`, and
`candidate` directly only for advanced debugging, custom research runs, or
recovering one step of a train session.

Option generation in `skillopt train continue` is durable and idempotent on
resume. Each review item's artifacts, item row, and options commit in a single
transaction the moment that item finishes, so an interrupted generation phase
keeps every item that already completed instead of losing the whole batch.
Re-running `skillopt train continue` regenerates only the incomplete items:
completed items are skipped, no duplicate options are written, and finished work
is never rewritten. If an item has some but not all of its options persisted,
resume hard-errors with `item <id> has partial generated options; inspect or
clear review options before continuing` so you can inspect or clear that item
before retrying.

`skillopt train recover` repairs the optimizer phase of a session by default — it
re-imports or repairs the optimizer candidate package and classifies the
iteration as `already_completed_candidate`, `already_completed_no_candidate`,
`optimizer_active`, or `corrupted_unrecoverable`:

```sh
gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id>
gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id> --out-root .gitmoot/skillopt/<run-id>
gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id> --json
```

`--out-root` overrides the optimizer output directory (it defaults to the
session's persisted optimizer path), and `--json` prints the recovery result as
JSON.

Pass `--generation` to recover the generation phase instead:

```sh
gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id> --generation
gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id> --generation --advance-state
gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id> --generation --abort
```

This reclaims a generation lock stranded by a crashed/killed `train continue`
(whose deferred lock release never ran) and salvages the persisted per-item
options. Reclamation is liveness-gated: the lock is released only when its owner
PID is provably dead AND it was held on this same host. A live owner is refused
(`skillopt train generation is already running`) so you stop the running process
first; a cross-host owner requires the lock TTL to expire. The recover process
re-acquires the lock for itself so the salvage is crash-safe. Salvage is
import-only — it reports `expected_items`, `recovered_items`, and `missing_items`
and classifies the run as `generation_complete`, `generation_incomplete`, or
`generation_active`. The iteration advances to `options_generated` only with
`--advance-state` and only when every expected item is recovered (regenerating
missing items remains `train continue`'s job). `--abort` reclaims the lock and
leaves the phase at `items_ready`, keeping persisted items. A stale generation
lock also surfaces in `train status` as a `stale` active lock, separate from the
true current phase.

`skillopt review create` starts a review run for a template and target repo.
Use the default A/B shape for validation, or pass `--mode explore|refine|distill`
with `--options N` for ranked exploration. `skillopt review item add` stores
saved baseline/candidate outputs as artifact-backed A/B review items, or
repeated `--option label=path` artifacts for ranked N-way items. `skillopt
review status` reports whether the run has items, complete artifacts, imported
feedback for every item, ranking stability, pairwise preference count, and a
recommended next mode. Recommendations are advisory; Gitmoot never changes mode,
imports a candidate, or promotes a template automatically.

`skillopt export` writes a JSON training package with the template snapshot,
eval run, review items, artifact manifests, feedback events when present, and
evaluator config. Use `gitmoot-skillopt optimize --training-package
training.json --artifact-root ~/.gitmoot/evals/blobs --out-root
.gitmoot/skillopt/<run-id> --candidate-output candidate.json --dry-run` first
to validate the contract without model calls.
Before real model-backed optimization, check `gitmoot-skillopt --version` and
`gitmoot-skillopt optimize --help`, or install it with
`pipx install https://github.com/plotarmordev/gitmoot-skillopt/releases/download/v0.4.2/gitmoot_skillopt-0.4.2-py3-none-any.whl`.
Verify required model/backend environment variables for the installed optimizer
version. `skillopt import` validates a candidate package and stores the
candidate template as a pending version; it never promotes the candidate
automatically. If the candidate package includes new artifact manifest entries,
pass `--artifact-dir` so Gitmoot can verify relative paths and SHA256 hashes
before storing blobs. `skillopt candidate show` displays candidate metadata, eval
report JSON, preference summary, and a content diff against the base/current
version. `skillopt candidate promote` makes a pending candidate current, while
`skillopt candidate reject` records an auditable rejection and prevents that
version from being selected by `@latest`.

`skillopt pairwise import <packet-dir>` ingests a **blinded paired-review
packet** produced by the gitmoot-skillopt fork (the `pairwise-review.json`
packet plus its secret map and the reviewer's picks), de-blinds it, and stores
the pairwise-preference feedback events — the import path for Mode B's
paired-review evidence. The daemon can also import review-issue feedback
automatically when started with `--watch-skillopt-reviews`.

At the manual promote/reject gate, Gitmoot records every judge↔human outcome
into a local store — all four directions: `agree_accept`, `agree_reject`,
`judge_accept_human_reject` (judge accepts, human rejects — a false positive),
and `judge_reject_human_accept` (judge rejects, human accepts — a false
negative). Each outcome is tagged with the judge prompt version, evaluator id,
and prompt hash that produced the score, so later analysis can compare judges by
prompt revision. This capture is measurement only: it never changes the judge,
overrides a decision, or bumps the result contract.

`skillopt judge-report` reads those captured outcomes and reports how well the
LLM judge is calibrated against human verdicts. It prints a confusion matrix
(the four `direction` buckets), the agreement rate and Cohen's κ, calibration
buckets (judge soft-score versus the human decision), and per-dimension
disagreement. Pass `--template <id>` to scope the report to one template, and
`--home <path>` to read from a non-default Gitmoot home. It is read-only.

`skillopt judge agreement` is the judge↔human agreement measurement harness
(#344). It joins the stored A/B judge verdicts (`skillopt ab --judge` /
jury rows) against the human ranked/pairwise feedback on the same
**comparison**: each `skillopt ab` invocation stamps a shared per-comparison
token on all of its rows, so repeated A/Bs of one challenger stay separate
observations (older tokenless rows are excluded and counted as unmeasurable,
never pooled; internal ties within one comparison are skipped and counted).
It reports Cohen's κ as the **headline** metric (raw agreement overstates
judge quality because it does not correct for chance), the raw agreement
rate, per-human-source and per-juror-family breakdowns, an
assignment-corrected position-bias audit over judge rows that carry the
recorded raw a/b pick (`P(pick=a)` stratified by the champion's presented
position and reported alongside `P(option A = champion)`; undefined when a
fixed `--seed` pinned the champion to one position), and a summary of the
candidate-level judge outcomes above. Small samples get a loud warning —
sample size is the limiter. `--json` emits the machine-readable report. It is
read-only.

`skillopt judge promote` closes the judge-prompt optimization loop: it applies an
**accepted** judge-prompt variant (from the judge-prompt optimizer's
`gitmoot-skillopt-judge-candidate` package) into a template, so the next
skill-opt run judges with the improved prompt. Select the variant with
`--task-kind <kind>` (use `_global` for the all-items pass). It **previews by
default** — printing the template id, task kind, the `baseline→best` agreement
delta, and a truncated prompt preview, and writing nothing — and requires
`--yes` to apply. It refuses (hard error) any variant whose `accepted` is not
true or whose `best_prompt` is empty, and any task kind missing from the package.
On apply it writes the prompt into the template's `evaluation` metadata
(`judge_prompt_templates` keyed by task kind, **merging** so other task kinds are
preserved, plus a bumped `judge_prompt_version`) and records a
`skillopt_judge_outcomes` audit row (`human_decision=promoted`, the old→new
version, and the agreement delta in `reason`). `--json` emits the machine-readable
preview/apply summary.

The Markdown feedback collector writes blind A/B review packets with `index.md`,
per-item Markdown files, editable `feedback.yml`, and hidden assignment metadata
that Gitmoot uses to validate the full response and import de-blinded canonical
feedback events. Open `index.md`, review every file in `items/*.md`, set
`reviewer`, edit `feedback.yml` with exactly one of `a`, `b`, `tie`, `neither`,
or `skip` for every item, and leave `.assignments.json` untouched.
Ranked packets use the same files, but `feedback.yml` contains ordered rankings
plus optional `useful_traits`, `rejected_traits`, and reasoning. After feedback
exists, packet summaries hide outcome-bearing phase details so later blind
reviewers do not see the current winner before responding.

The GitHub feedback collector publishes the same blind A/B review packet to a
new issue by default, or to an existing PR when `--pr <number>` is provided.
Repository resolution uses `--repo`, then the eval run target repo, then the
template source repo, then optional `[feedback].repo = "owner/reviews"` in
Gitmoot config. Reviewers can reply with full YAML or run-scoped short-form
lines such as `run_id: run-1` followed by `item-001: b - More concrete.`.
`github sync` imports valid comments into canonical feedback events and ignores
unrelated comments safely.
Ranked GitHub comments can use `item-001 ranking: C > A > D > B` plus trait
notes. Use the ranked workflow for exploration/refinement and return to A/B
validation for final promotion decisions on fresh items.
