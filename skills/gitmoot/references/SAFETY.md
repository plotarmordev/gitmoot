# Gitmoot Safety Reference

## Repo Scope

A PR repository is the routing context for `/gitmoot <agent> ...`. Always confirm
or pass `--repo owner/repo` when the user works across multiple repositories.

## Branch Locks

Implementation jobs must respect Gitmoot branch locks. Do not edit or push an
implementation branch unless Gitmoot assigned the job and the branch lock is held
by the assigned agent.

Review and ask jobs should inspect and report without mutating branches unless
the task explicitly instructs otherwise.

Do not ask child agents to run PR lifecycle commands such as `git pull`,
`git merge`, `git push`, or `gh pr merge` to make parallel task PRs mergeable.
Gitmoot owns the final merge gate. It serializes merge attempts per base branch,
updates stale PR branches through GitHub when possible, retries pending states
through the daemon, and blocks clearly when GitHub reports a real merge
conflict.

Useful commands:

```sh
gitmoot lock list --repo owner/repo
gitmoot lock show owner/repo <branch>
```

## Files And Secrets

Do not commit generated data, caches, logs, build outputs, session archives,
cloned helper repos, secrets, credentials, or large artifacts unless the user or
plan explicitly says they are intended tracked fixtures or release assets.

Redact secrets from GitHub comments, job summaries, raw examples, and copied
command output.

## External Contracts

If the work depends on external APIs, CLIs, env vars, generated scripts, service
launchers, installers, deployment behavior, or third-party libraries, verify the
real contract with local commands and/or official documentation before editing.

## Delegation Termination Bounds

These bounds keep an orchestra finite: when you orchestrate an orchestra of
agents, the conductor's score and the players it spawns cannot recurse or fan out
forever. Delegation and coordinator-continuation chains are bounded so they
cannot recurse or fan out forever:

- Depth cap `MaxDelegationDepth = 8`: each delegation child and each coordinator
  continuation increments `delegation_depth`. A job at or beyond this depth may
  not delegate further.
- Per-root job budget `MaxDelegationTotalJobs = 64`: the whole delegation tree
  under one root (all children and continuations sharing that root) is capped.
  When a batch would exceed it, the delegations are not dispatched.
- Per-root wall-clock budget `MaxDelegationWallClock = 2h`: the whole tree under
  one root is bounded in duration (measured from the root job's creation); a
  coordinator that tries to fan out after the tree has run this long is refused
  with a `delegation_walltime_exceeded` event. A generous runaway backstop, not a
  tight deadline.
- Per-root token budget (cost) `[orchestrate].max_delegation_token_budget`,
  **off by default** (`0` = unlimited): when set to a positive value, the whole
  tree under one root is bounded by cumulative token usage (input + output across
  every job in the tree). A coordinator that tries to fan out after the tree has
  already used at least the budget is refused with a `delegation_cost_exceeded`
  event. Token capture is **best-effort per runtime** (Claude reports usage; Kimi
  reports it if its stream emits it; Codex `Deliver` runs without `--json` and so
  contributes `0`), so the budget can under-count but never over-counts. Leaving
  the knob at `0` skips the check entirely.
- Per-coordinator width `MaxDelegationWidth = 16`: a single coordinator result
  may not fan out more than this many delegations in one generation; an over-wide
  set is refused with a `delegation_width_exceeded` event.
- Loop detection: a canonical windowed signature hash over recent delegation
  activity halts repeated or cyclic delegation chains well before the depth cap
  is reached, preventing oscillating A→B→A loops.
- Operator kill switch: `gitmoot job kill <root-job-id>` lets an operator
  terminate a runaway tree by its root id from outside. It is the **first**
  backstop, so operator action wins over every budget cap. The kill is graceful,
  not a hard stop — in-flight jobs finish normally, the coordinator's next
  continuation routes through the same finalize path below (a
  `delegation_killed` event is emitted), and the daemon stops starting queued
  children of the killed root.

When a bound trips, the offending delegations are not dispatched and the parent
receives a typed lifecycle event explaining why (for example, the delegation tree
for a root reached the job budget of 64). Rather than stopping silently, the
engine then enqueues one **graceful finalize continuation**
(`delegation_finalize_enqueued`) back to the coordinator — told it cannot
delegate further and asked to synthesize a best-effort final result and return
empty delegations. That continuation is terminal: any delegations it returns are
ignored (`delegation_finalized`), so work is bounded and always ends in a clean
synthesis, not a silent dead end.

## When To Stop

Stop and report `blocked` when the target repo is unclear, GitHub auth is
missing, the daemon cannot access the repo, branch lock ownership is wrong, or
continuing would require credentials or destructive operations the user did not
approve.
