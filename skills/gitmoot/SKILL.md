# Gitmoot Agent Skill

Gitmoot is a local-first coordinator for AI agents working across repositories,
goals, reviews, PR comments, and runtime workflows. Use this skill when the
user wants PR-comment agent workflows, repo-scoped agent subscriptions,
background daemon checks, Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code agent startup, structured
implementation plans, standard goal files, agent template workflows, custom
prompt agents, template capture, job status, or branch lock inspection.

For current-chat prompt import, "use <agent> here" or "use Gitmoot agent
<agent> here" means run `gitmoot agent prompt <agent>` and apply the returned
prompt content in this current chat. This is prompt import, not true
system-prompt injection. The natural phrase "use the Gitmoot planner here" maps
to the same `planner` template used by managed planner agents. If the planner
template is not cached, read and apply the packaged
`agent-templates/planner.md` instructions directly. Do not route a "here"
request through a background `gitmoot agent ask` unless the user explicitly
asks for background execution, PR-comment routing, or job tracking.

For template capture, phrases like "capture this session as a Gitmoot agent
template", "turn this workflow into a Gitmoot template", or "draft a reusable
agent template from this chat" mean read [TEMPLATE_CAPTURE.md](references/TEMPLATE_CAPTURE.md)
and distill the visible current-chat context into a draft template. Gitmoot
cannot read hidden model memory or runtime internals. Do not install, overwrite,
or update a permanent template unless the user explicitly approves that step.
Use `gitmoot agent template draft <id>` for a blank scaffold,
`gitmoot agent template validate <file>` for a structural check,
`gitmoot agent template add <id> --file <file>` to install a snapshot, and
`gitmoot agent prompt <id>` to reuse the installed template in the current chat.

For background work, keep Gitmoot's resource model explicit: repo checkout
locks protect local checkouts, runtime session locks serialize delivery for the
same Codex, Claude, or Kimi session, and branch locks protect implementation
ownership.
The daemon default is `--workers 1`; raise it only for independent runtime
sessions or managed agent types with `max_background` greater than one.

For Gitmoot health or status questions, first use the injected SessionStart
snapshot when it is present and sufficient. If more detail is needed, run the
relevant read-only Gitmoot CLI checks and answer directly from the results.
Mention `gitmoot dashboard` only after that answer, as a live monitoring
follow-up. Do not start daemons, create agents, change subscriptions, update
templates, or release locks unless the user asks for that action.

## Before Acting

1. Check whether `gitmoot` is installed with `gitmoot version`.
2. Confirm GitHub CLI access with `gh auth status` only before using PR
   workflows or remote GitHub actions.
3. Detect or ask for the target repo before starting daemons, subscribing agents,
   or routing jobs.
4. Do not start daemons, create agents, update agent templates, or change
   subscriptions, or release locks unless the user asks or the current task
   clearly requires it.
5. Prefer the SessionStart snapshot and read-only status commands, then answer
   directly before mutating Gitmoot state or pointing the user to live
   monitoring.

## Common Commands

Use the SessionStart "Current snapshot" for quick repo-local daemon/task/job/lock
answers when available. Use `gitmoot status --repo owner/repo` for concise repo
status, `gitmoot daemon status` for daemon state, `gitmoot agent list` and
`gitmoot agent show <agent>` for registered agents. Use `gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo`
or `gitmoot task list --repo owner/repo --json` for imported task state. Use
`gitmoot job list --repo owner/repo` for jobs, and use
`gitmoot dashboard --json` only when a structured full dashboard snapshot is
needed. Do not use nonexistent commands such as `gitmoot status --json` or
`gitmoot task show`. Use `gitmoot agent prompt <agent-or-template>` to import an
agent prompt into the current chat. Use
`gitmoot agent run <agent> --repo owner/repo "..."` for coordinator delegation
so Gitmoot can route to ask, review, or implement and own worktrees, branch
locks, commits, pushes, PRs, and workflow advancement. Use
`gitmoot agent ask <agent> --repo owner/repo "..."` only for
analysis, planning, or questions. Use `gitmoot agent review <agent> --repo
owner/repo --pr <number> "..."` for PR review decisions and `gitmoot agent
implement <agent> --repo owner/repo --task <task-id> "..."` for file changes.
Add `--background` only when the user wants a queued background job.

Orchestrate (Orchestra): when the user says "orchestrate …" or "spin up an
orchestra of agents", run a background coordinator that returns a `delegations[]`
score so the players (child agents) run and a finale (continuation) reconvenes
and synthesizes. `gitmoot orchestrate <agent> "..." [--repo R]` is sugar for
`gitmoot agent run <agent> --background "..."`. See
[RESULT_CONTRACT.md](references/RESULT_CONTRACT.md) for the delegation fields and
termination bounds. A coordinator can also spawn throwaway, auto-disposed
ephemeral workers on demand via a delegation's `ephemeral` spec (no
pre-registration; mutually exclusive with `agent`). An agent (via `--model` on start/subscribe/type set) and an
individual job or delegation (via `--model` on run/ask/review/implement or the
delegation `model` field) can pin a runtime model, with the per-job/delegation
value overriding the agent default. Use
`gitmoot plugin doctor` when checking whether Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi Code
can discover Gitmoot through an installed runtime plugin. Use
`gitmoot plugin codex-launch --repo <path>` to print a Codex launch command that
adds the resolved `.gitmoot` home to the sandbox on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Use `gitmoot goal template` when
writing a standard task-by-task goal file. Use
`gitmoot report bug --job <job-id> --preview` to inspect a redacted GitHub issue
draft for failed, blocked, or cancelled jobs; use
`gitmoot report bug --job <job-id> --create --yes` only when the user
explicitly asks you to file it or the active workflow policy permits automatic
bug filing.

The plugin is only the runtime discovery surface for this skill. Local agent
invocation still goes through the `gitmoot` CLI and the same registered agent,
repo access, runtime adapter, and job history model used by PR-comment jobs.

For Gitmoot bug reports, preview by default and treat the preview as the
confirmation surface. Generated reports include redacted job context, recent
events, labels, and a fingerprint marker for duplicate detection. After
creation, tell the user the printed issue URL; if Gitmoot reused an existing
issue, report that URL as existing instead of new.

For SkillOpt template learning, prefer the high-level
`gitmoot skillopt train start/status/continue/stop` workflow when the user wants
Gitmoot to enforce the full feedback, optimizer, candidate-review, and
promotion loop. Use low-level `gitmoot skillopt review`, `feedback`, `export`,
`import`, and `candidate` commands for advanced/debug work or when recovering a
specific step. In train mode, collect enough ranked feedback and trait notes
before optimizer handoff, check `gitmoot-skillopt --version` and
`gitmoot-skillopt optimize --help` when optimizer-backed continue is needed,
keep promotion decisions explicit, and start follow-up iterations only through
`train continue --start-next`. Generation is durable: each review item's
artifacts and options commit in one transaction the moment that item finishes,
so an interrupted phase resumes idempotently when you re-run `train continue` —
already-complete items are skipped and never duplicated, while an item with some
but not all options persisted returns a hard error to inspect or clear before
continuing. For optimizer-phase recovery, use
`gitmoot skillopt train recover --session <id> [--out-root path] [--json]`,
which re-imports or repairs the optimizer candidate package and classifies the
iteration; it does not release the generation lock or rebuild generation
options.

For complete command examples, read [CLI.md](references/CLI.md).
For end-to-end workflows, read [WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md).
For current-chat template capture, read
[TEMPLATE_CAPTURE.md](references/TEMPLATE_CAPTURE.md).
For the canonical goal prompt template, read
[GOAL_TEMPLATE.md](references/GOAL_TEMPLATE.md) only when the user asks for a
goal file.

## Agent Job Contract

Every Gitmoot job should return a concise and truthful `gitmoot_result` JSON
object. Use `blocked` when work cannot continue without human input or external
state, and `failed` when an attempted action errored.

For the required result shape and decision meanings, read
[RESULT_CONTRACT.md](references/RESULT_CONTRACT.md).

## Safety Rules

Preserve existing behavior unless the job explicitly changes it. Keep work
scoped to the target repo. Do not commit generated data, caches, logs, secrets,
session archives, cloned helper repos, or large outputs unless explicitly
requested. Respect Gitmoot branch locks for implementation jobs.

For detailed safety and lock rules, read [SAFETY.md](references/SAFETY.md).

## When Unsure

Reread this `SKILL.md`, then inspect `/gitmoot help`, `gitmoot status`, and the
relevant job events before acting.
